1. Prior to Watson in 2007, mark what was the precision of a QA computer system in question answering?â€¨
    - 20% - Prior to Watson, the prevailing technology could only answer questions with about 20% accuracy. To win at Jeopardy! against a grand champion, Watson had to be able to answer 70% of the questions at 90% precision.
2. Which of the following areas of expertise is not needed as a background to deeply understand the remaining lectures of this course?
    - 3. Game Theory - It is not strictly required to be familiar with all of these subjects to follow the rest of this course, and in particular the first two lectures on the Deep QA architecture. However, basic notions of these areas are needed to understand the more advanced lessons.
3. The question answering technology in IBM Watson is innovative because it analyzes both structured and unstructured data. Mark where on the following continuum between structured and unstructured data, where the answers tend to come from.
    - 10/90 - Most of the content that Watson used to answer Jeopardy! questions came from unstructured data. Structured knowledge search provided the answer for less than 10 percent of the questions.
4. Tycor helps Watson to:
	- 1. Recognize is_a relations between the candidate answer and the expected type. - Type correlation, or Tycor, is used to evaluate candidate answers by comparing the lexical answer type in the question and in the candidate answers.
