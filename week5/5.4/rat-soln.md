1. Which of the following will increase the difficulty of extracting information from medical records? (Please select ALL that apply)
	a, b, c, d - Medical records tend to have issues like poor quality of text, misspellings, use of nonstandard abbreviations, and a complex, unorganized structure. These issues make information extraction from medical records challenging. However, the large amount of text in medical records is not a challenge for automatic systems like Watson.
2. Which of the following is NOT a feature of JoBimText?
	c) Using supervised learning approaches for Knowledge Base Population- JoBimText has a scalable Distributional Similarity engine based on Hadoop. It has a UIMA-based text processing system that allows the integration of different analytics. It also has features like sense clustering, lexical substitution, word sense disambiguation, and thesauri induction.
3. Which is the best approach for relation detection in medical records?
	d) Distributional relation detection - Traditional relation extraction has the lowest relation detection accuracy. Latent Semantic Analysis performs better than traditional relation extraction by providing higher coverage at the cost of low precision. However, distributional relation detection is the best approach for relation detection in medical records, as it has the highest relation detection accuracy.
4. What knowledge base do most search engines use?
	d) Freebase - Most search engines use Freebase, which is a large collaborative knowledge base that describes semantic relationship types and other properties of most entities on the web.
