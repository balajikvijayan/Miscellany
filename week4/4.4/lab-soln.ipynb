       "    'text': 'Introduction San Francisco has a long history of implementing recycling programs-from the early industrial recovery of metals and paper, to the birth of the environmental movement around Earth Day 1970, up to the current leading edge programs and the City\\'s adoption of waste diversion goals of 75% by 2010 and \"Zero Waste\" by 2020. A 1932 voter approved Refuse Ordinance created a permit system for the exclusive right to collect garbage and recyclables that have no \"commercial value\" - where the generator is charged for collection service. Eventually, various companies owning these permits combined through corporate buy-outs into Norcal Waste Systems Co., which now owns all 97 permits. Recycling services, while not specified in the 1932 ordinance, have been included by interpretation. Other recycling collectors may only collect materials with \"commercial value\", and may not charge for collection services. Construction and demolition (C&D) waste activities are specifically outside the 1932 ordinance. Numerous companies do compete for this business but Norcal still handles well over 50% of all C&D materials. Reuse collection is also outside of the ordinance. Oversight of the garbage and recycling system is unusual in that there is no standard contract. Residential rates are set by a three person Rate Board (City Administrator, Controller and head of Public Utilities) with technical review assistance by City staff from the Department of Public Works (DPW), Department of the Environment (SF Environment) and City Attorney. Commercial rates are not regulated, but reflect the rate increases set by the Rate Review process. DPW staff administer the financial aspects of the rate system while the Department of Public Health (DPH) issues Refuse permits, enforces public health standards and adjudicates billing and service disputes. The California Integrated Waste Management Board oversees diversion efforts by municipalities and enforces AB 939 - the Integrated Waste Management Act - passed in 1989, which set a 50% recycling goal for California. SF Environment is the city department charged with meeting these state diversion goals and it provides program development and performance oversight of Norcal. Without direct command and control, SF Environment has developed a close working relationship with Norcal to advance the City\\'s resource recovery goals. In February 2003, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors adopted a goal of diverting 75% of waste from the landfill by 2010 and achieving \"zero waste\" by 2020. Strategies to achieve these goals include development and expansion of new programs through improvements to the recycling and market infrastructures, as well as education, outreach and legislative policy actions to help in product lifecycle redesign for reuse, recycling and composting. Solid Waste Actions to Reduce Emissions Recommended renewable energy actions are grouped into six categories, listed in table 3.5. Estimated CO2 reduction has been estimated by category. Specific actions are described below. Existing Actions SF Environment, in partnership with Norcal and its subsidiaries, including the City\\'s exclusive permitted haulers (Sunset Scavenger and Golden Gate Disposal & Recycling) as well as other organizations, has developed and is implementing innovative city-wide recycling and composting programs in the residential and commercial sectors of San Francisco. These programs resulted in San Francisco achieving a 52% landfill diversion rate in 2001 and with maximum expansion will help San Francisco to achieve its 75% diversion goal. These programs are being recognized as valuable models that many communities are striving to emulate. Among these new programs, San Francisco is implementing the first large rollout of food and other organics collection and composting in a large U.S city. Started as a commercial produce pilot in 1996, food collection has expanded citywide to include all food scraps (including post-consumer and meat), food soiled paper, waxed cardboard, wood crates and landscape trimmings from all types of generators, including markets, restaurants, cafes, juice bars, florists, hotels, schools and universities. After nearly three years of pilot programs, a new 3-cart collection program, called the \"Fantastic 3\", began in February 2000 for households and small businesses. This program replaced the previous separate open blue bin recycling and trash collections that had no organics collection. Proposed Actions The proposed actions described in this section are all expansions of existing actions. A. Increase Residential Recycling and Composting Estimated CO2 Reduction: 70,000 tons Expand Recycling and Composting Programs Fantastic 3 is San Francisco\\'s residential and small business recycling and composting collection program serving single-family homes, apartments, and small businesses that are integral to residential neighborhoods. Recyclables and refuse are collected by dual compartment, semiautomatic, compacting collection trucks. Compostables are collected using semiautomatic, side loading, single- compartment, compacting trucks. Through the Fantastic 3 program, residents and small businesses receive three color-coded wheeled 32 gallon carts - blue for commingled recyclables, including all paper, cardboard, bottles, and cans; green for Table 3.5 Summary of Solid Waste Actions and Estimated CO2 Reductions ! 95 Not quantified, unknown materials breakdown. 96 Municipal waste reduction is included in the commercial recycling and composting program totals. Solid Waste Action Categories Estimated CO2 Reduction (tons) A. Increase Residential Recycling and Composting 70,000 B. Increase Commercial Recycling and Composting 109,000 C. Expand Construction and Demolition Debris Recycling 57,000 D. Support Alternate Collection Methods for Recyclable Materials 66,000 E. Promote Source Reduction, Reuse and Other Waste Reduction95 - F. Expand Municipal Programs96 - Total 302,000 all compostable food scraps, yard trimmings, wooden crates, animal bedding, and soiled paper; and black for any remaining refuse. Residents also receive a 2-gallon kitchen pail to help them separate and collect food scraps. Further expansion of recycling and composting programs to multifamily apartment buildings and increasing participation through outreach, adding new materials and adopting mandatory policies, will divert an estimated 223,252 tons/year of residential recycling and compost by 2012. This total includes separate program tonnages of 154,471 tons of recyclables and 68,781 tons of organic material. B. Increase Commercial Recycling and Composting Estimated CO2 Reduction: 109,000 tons Expand Commercial Recycling San Francisco should continue to expand its commercial recycling programs, which include source-separated collection, bagged co-collection (in which loose paper and other recyclables are separated from bagged refuse) and re-routing (where trucks collect from generators rich in recyclables separately). The commercial programs accept all types of paper, cardboard, glass, metal and plastic. Commercial accounts with wood, light metals, film plastic and other common industrial materials are processed at the new Pier 96 Materials Recovery Facility (MRF). The addition of this advanced sorting and processing operation at Pier 96, along with increased outreach, adding new materials to recycle and adopting mandatory polices will result in substantial increases in diversion of commercial recyclable material from the landfill. By 2012, this program will be recovering 186,026 tons of recyclables per year. Expand Commercial Composting Commercial composting programs have expanded dramatically in the past two years. With the commercial source-separated organics program, most businesses in the program have been able to reduce their trash volume and service significantly, diverting 50% or more of their waste through composting and recycling. A number of restaurants have exceeded 90% diversion. With maximum expansion of commercial organics Fantastic 3 Program Fantastic 3 is San Francisco\\'s residential and small business recycling and composting collection program serving single-family homes, apartments, and small businesses. In the Fantastic 3 program, residents and small businesses receive three color-coded wheeled 32 gallon carts: green for all compostable food scraps, yard trimmings, wooden crates, animal bedding, and soiled paper; blue for \"comingled\" recyclables, including all paper, cardboard, bottles, and cans; and black for any remaining refuse. Residents also receive a 2-gallon kitchen pail to help them separate and collect food scraps. collection through outreach, requiring use of compostable products, and adopting mandatory policies, the projection for 2012 is that 79,275 tons of compostable material will be diverted per year. C. Expand Construction and Demolition Debris Recycling Estimated CO2 Reduction: 57,000 tons Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste represents a significant portion of the total waste stream in San Francisco - up to 20% depending on which materials are included. Several companies provide service, including Norcal Waste Systems, Specialty Crushing, and Waste Resource Technology. The total C&D material diverted annually as a result of these expanded programs combined is estimated to be 493,056 tons debris by 2012. Norcal Waste Systems C&D. Norcal has a construction and demolition debris recycling program in which roll-off bins are used to collect concrete, wood, metal, and other materials from industrial, construction, and demolition sites. Norcal\\'s new construction and demolition debris sorting facility began operations in July 2003 and will triple Norcal\\'s current capacity. The old temporary sorting line is now used to improve diversion at the public disposal and recycling area. These improvements are projected to increase construction and demolition debris recycling to 142,335 tons debris diverted per year by 2012. Specialty Crushing C&D. Specialty Crushing performs specialized recovery of inert materials, primarily concrete, asphalt, rock and brick. Specialty has expanded their operations to include more materials and make new products, such as Envirocrete - a trademarked non-structural concrete suitable for all sidewalk, curb ramp and street use made from brick, dredge spoils and other recovered inerts. Through the addition of new processing capacity and the development of markets for new and existing products, Specialty plans to expand the amount of C&D materials it processes each year - and by 2012 the amount projected for diversion is 286,959 tons per year. Other C&D. In San Francisco and the greater Bay Area, dozens of companies process some portion of the C&D waste stream. Collectively, this set of processors is growing in number and processing capacity. The growth in this service area is due in part to the recent development of C&D ordinances in Bay Area jurisdictions requiring minimum recovery rates from C&D projects. Total estimated waste diverted in 2012 from this program will be 63,762 tons debris per year. D. Support Alternate Collection Methods for Recyclable Materials Estimated CO2 Reduction: 66,000 tons Increase Metals Recycling Metals have routinely been recovered from the waste stream for many years. San Francisco does not measure all the metals recovered, only the new increment beyond what was traditionally recovered prior to 1990. New processing equipment for debris box loads is being built and new programs to recover electronic waste will provide a significant increase in the amount of metals recovered. In 2001, San Francisco recovered 19,345 tons and it is projected that 30,028 tons of metals will be recovered annually by 2012. This is in addition to increased metal recovery from the C&D waste stream. Support Community Drop-off, Buy-back and Collection There are a number of recycling programs which do not fall under Norcal\\'s programs or other processing programs. These include donations at community recycling centers, the buy-back of California Redemption Value (CRV) beverage containers, and numerous collection programs operated by non-profit organizations or independent companies. A total if 37,307 tons of waste was diverted in 2001 - a figure that is projected to remain stable through 2012. Support Recovery by Material Handlers This area includes activity by independent recyclers such as paper dealers, re-use centers like Goodwill for furniture and textiles, and electronic waste reuse and recycling. These operators were responsible for diverting 92,074 tons in 2001 and this figure is projected to remain steady through 2012. New programs are being developed in this area and subsequent projections will very likely see increases for some materials in this group. E. Promote Source Reduction, Reuse and Other Waste Reduction Efforts to reduce the use of materials through reuse, substitution, re-designed products and processes have been identified, are growing and all fall into this category. Examples include: reuse of pallets and lumber in multiple shipping and construction applications; refilling toner cartridges, replacement of printed newsletters and reports by electronic versions; road base specifications that include tires, glass, brick and other previously discarded materials; and processing waste glass and ceramic into landscape, artistic, or building materials and products. Waste audits frequently reveal creative diversion activities and new techniques. In 2001, 65,620 tons were identified as being diverted through these methods. By 2012, 70,362 tons will be diverted annually. F. Expand Municipal Programs Continue Sludge/Alternative Daily Cover Program The City currently diverts the solid leftover from sewage treatment to landfills and agricultural sites. The material is then applied to agricultural land or used at the landfill for daily cover called Alternative Daily Cover (ADC), erosion control or other engineered uses-all regarded as diversion activities by the California Integrated Waste Management Board. In 2001 the City diverted 96,010 tons of sludge to use in this manner, a level projected to remain constant through 2012. Expand Recycling in City Facilities San Francisco has a goal to set a resource conservation example to residents and businesses through its own practices. The key element of this effort is the Resource Conservation Ordinance (RCO). The City adopted the first RCO a decade ago to reduce waste and increase purchasing of recycled products by City departments. The original RCO was completely amended in 2000 to further improve resource conservation practices and states that it is the goal of the City and every department to maximize purchases of recycled products and divert from disposal as much solid waste as possible. The RCO sets minimum recovered material content requirements for the purchase of building insulation products, paper and paper products, motor oil, tires and other products. Purchasing requirements are important to support markets for recovered materials. Examples of minimum requirements are: Copier, printing and writing paper - 30% post-consumer content; Paper towels - 40% post-consumer content; and Motor oil - 25% re-refined oil content. The RCO establishes a framework to assist departments in minimizing waste disposal. First, it requires each department to submit and distribute a Compliance Letter committing the department to the RCO goals and designating at least one person responsible for compliance. Second, a Departmental Waste Assessment (DWA) documenting all waste diverted and disposed must be submitted. Third, each department is to submit a Resource Conservation Plan (RCP) outlining how it will achieve RCO goals. Lastly, each department submits an Annual Recycling Survey (ARS) reporting solid waste diversion. The RCO requires that the SF Environment submit this Annual Report to the Board of Supervisors summarizing department implementation and listing departments failing to conform. The information contained in this report came from the above submittals, site visits and other communications with departments. Materials Recovered Table 3.6 shows the breakdown of materials recovered from City facilities by material category - C&D debris, organics and recyclables. C&D refers to construction and demolition debris such as wood, concrete, asphalt, brick, tile, dirt, metal, and salvaged fixtures. Organics consists of logs, plant trimmings, food scraps, grease, soil, manure and sludge. Recyclables include paper, cardboard, bottles and cans, window glass and pallets. The City has embarked on an aggressive campaign to reduce waste and increase diversion in all city departments and facilities. One goal is the central management and coordination of all garbage and resource conservation services. Another goal is significant savings on the cost of garbage and recycling services. Tons of material diverted are expected to increase significantly as well. Processing Facility Improvements Commingled recyclables from the Fantastic 3 program and the commercial recycling programs are taken to a new recyclables processing facility at Pier 96, which began full-time operation in January 2003. This facility is the largest recycling processing center on the West Coast, employing state of the art separation systems, with a daily capacity of 2,100 tons and initial overall diversion of 75% that SF Environment and Norcal hope to increase up to 85% over time. Source-separated organics loads from residential and commercial programs are taken directly to the transfer station, loaded into trailers, and then hauled to Norcal\\'s Jepsen Prairie Organics Composting Facility in Vacaville. The material is composted for two months using an enclosed, aerated Ag-Bag composting system, windrow-turned and cured for a month, and then screened. The finished compost is marketed to landscaping and agriculture users, including organic farmers and vineyards. Some of the compost is used by farmers who market their produce to the same restaurants and markets in San Francisco that generate the organic material that Norcal collects. Substantial new capacity for processing Construction and Demolition materials has been built by Norcal. Norcal\\'s existing C&D facility has been enclosed and a second sort line added and new conveyance and processing systems integrated. This project will increase the existing capacity by 200-300%, and improve recovery rates. The facility began operations in July 2003 with a capacity to sort more than 300 tons per day. Specialty Crushing has proposed adding a sorting line that will allow acceptance of heavily inert loads with minor contaminants such as brick, metal and wood. In conjunction with the sorting capability, Specialty intends to automate batching of new mixes that include previously discarded materials for use in road base, sidewalk and curb work. Those materials include brick, dredge spoils and mixed ceramic glass. Approval of this new facility is under consideration at the Port of San Francisco and operation is expected to be on line in 2005. San Francisco already has several mechanisms in place to facilitate work towards our greenhouse gas reduction goal. Many of the efforts now underway to reduce vehicle emissions, increase energy efficiency and renewable energy, and increase recycling can provide an impetus to move the City in the right direction. Our challenge is to expand and increase the capacity of these actions, and to link them under the common goal of climate protection. Significant investments will be required if we are to meet our goal. Chapter 4 provides a list of recommended next steps to implement these actions. !

       "    'text': '2 emissions but some other gases in the case of aluminum recycling for example). This is the so-called \"non-methane factor\" in the Fuel and Waste Coefficient utility in this software. R is the rate of landfill gas recovery to be applied. In the CCP campaign we ask that all inventories by computed using the landfill gas recovery rate that was already extant in the base year of the local action plan and that any landfill gas recovery introduced subsequent to the base year be entered as a Measure in the appropriate module. Thus, target year inventories in our business-as-usual forecasts are computed with the base year landfill gas recovery factor. A separate value of R can be specified to be used when computing the impact of waste reduction measures, thus avoiding double counting any methane that has already been recovered as part of a landfill gas recovery measure implemented since the base year of the plan. The methane recovery factors are set in the Methane Factors item on the Settings Menu in the software. In the case of the Analysis module, B has been set to zero in all previous versions of the CCP software, but now values of B have been entered to reflect the EPA conclusions on the extent of carbon sequestration in landfills. These new values of B (see Table A) are negative for the organic waste types tracked in the Analysis modules (paper products, food scraps, plant debris, and wood/textiles), reflecting the fact that they are tracking the sequestration of carbon in the landfill (i.e. a \"negative\" source, or sink). Because the A coefficient is generally larger than the B coefficient, landfills will continue to be characterized as net sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the CCP software unless the value of R (methane recovery) is high enough to reduce the impact of methane emissions below that of carbon sequestration. In the Measures module, the B factor is used to quantify the upstream greenhouse gas emission reductions that result when various waste types are reduced, recycled or composted. These are generally the energy-related carbon dioxide emissions that are avoided from the enormous energy savings that accrue when the use of energy intensive materials is either reduced or when virgin raw materials (e.g. wood pulp) can be replaced with recycled materials (e.g. recycled paper) in the manufacturing of these materials. These upstream effects occur with all materials, not just organic materials. In fact, some of the largest upstream GHG emission impacts are associated with the reduction or recycling of inorganic materials such as aluminum. The B factors that are shown in the table below reflect the emission impacts relative to landfilling, which is the reference technology throughout the Waste sectors of the CCP software. As such, they already incorporate the moderating impact of the carbon sequestration at the landfill. It is important to note how much larger the B factors are for the waste diversion measures than for the inventory waste types. The upstream emission reductions from three R measures are large compared to all the landfill impacts. This is why waste reduction and recycling measures continue to be by far the most effective strategies for reducing the greenhouse gas impacts from waste. The final column in Table A indicates the net emissions or emission reductions, in tons of eCO2 per ton of waste, at landfills where 90% of methane is recovered. In the top half of the table, corresponding to the quantification of emissions from landfilled waste, we can see that the net coefficient becomes fairly strongly negative for paper products, plant debris, textiles and wood waste. The carbon sequestration factor is dominating because most of the methane is being recovered. Landfills with high rates of methane recovery will operate as net sinks under these conditions. On the other hand, a glance at the final column for the bottom part of the table that shows the net impact of recycling and reducing various waste types, it is evident that even after allowing for the sequestration impact and high rates of methane recovery, waste reduction and recycling measures are still much more preferable to landfills in terms of the overall impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The only possible exceptions to this occur for municipal solid waste incineration and composting of plant debris. In the case of the MSW incineration, this is because the net effect of diverting mixed waste from landfill in order to burn it is that the sequestration benefits are totally foregone and the avoided methane emissions are insufficient to offset that loss. Because plant debris has a relatively low methane generation rate in landfills and a relatively high carbon sequestration coefficient, the net effect on greenhouse gas emissions of diverting it from landfill is that a relatively small amount of methane emissions are avoided and a relatively large amount of eCO2 is released that would have been sequestered. This is not an argument against composting, which has many benefits independent of its greenhouse gas impacts. Furthermore, the only reason that the coefficient comes out negative is because we have taken landfills as the reference practice and in this reference practice some eCO2 gets sequestered that would otherwise have been released to the atmosphere as part of the natural carbon cycle. In this sense, the negative coefficient for centralized composting is somewhat misleading, as the eCO2 released from the compost would have been released in nature in any other reference scenario except landfilling. With respect to municipal waste incineration, caution should also be used here in attaching too much significance to the negative net coefficient, partly for the same reasons described above for composting and partly because with incineration there may be other offsetting emission benefits. For example, if the incinerator is used to produce electricity, which displaces coal-fired or oil-fired electricity generation, the net greenhouse gas impact can be and in many locations is highly favorable. The default values for the A and B coefficients being used in this edition of the software are shown in Table A below. Note that for the waste measures, the B coefficients vary not only by waste type but also by measure type (i.e. reduction vs. recycling). This is because the upstream energy reductions are different (usually greater) for waste reduction measures than for waste recycling measures. The coefficients in the table do not include the energy use by waste collection trucks - in the CCP software, the fuel use of the community\\'s vehicle fleet, including the garbage and recycling trucks, is reported elsewhere. In any event, on a per ton of waste basis, it is relatively insignificant. The methane related coefficients (the A factors) are all based on an assumption of zero methane recovery at the landfill. In the CCP software, methane recovery factors (R in the equation above) are entered separately and are not incorporated in coefficients. The utilization of recovered landfill gas for various purposes, such as electricity generation, is also treated elsewhere in the CCP software (as a fuel switching measure) and the coefficients in Table A do not reflect any assumptions about landfill gas applications. Finally, the coefficients for MSW recycling do not contain any credit for ferrous metal recovery. Cities are encouraged to identify and report this explicitly when it is practiced in their community.

       "    'text': 'This section outlines the recommended steps to implement the Climate Action Plan in the next three years and the likely implementing agencies, funding sources, and progress indicators. More detailed descriptions of the actions are found in Chapter 3. Transportation The transportation sector accounts for approximately 50 percent of San Francisco\\'s CO2 emissions. Reducing transportation emissions is a complex endeavor- host of policy, regulatory, and financial variables exist that influence the City\\'s ability to achieve emissions reductions. Many actions that can result in large emissions reductions are controlled by federal entities, such as Congress, and the Federal Transportation Administration or by regional administrative agencies like the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). It is necessary therefore, to pursue a wide range of actions that can be supported in San Francisco, while recognizing that they may also require policy changes in the larger regional and national transportation sectors. A. Public Transit One major approach to reducing transportation sector emissions is to reduce vehicle trips by encouraging a shift from privately owned vehicles to public transit. In order for public transit to provide a viable and attractive transportation option, local and regional services must provide efficient and reliable service to as many locations as possible. The \"Transit First\" policy has already been officially adopted in San Francisco. The next steps for improving transit will need to be coordinated between all the responsible agencies, City departments and the regional transportation entities. Next Steps: Expand local transit service. Dedicate more funding for Muni capital improvements, fulfilling the vision outlined in Muni\\'s long range planning document, A Vision for Rapid Transit in San Francisco. Expand and improve regional service and interconnections. Develop a regional transit pass system. Improve Muni safety, customer service and user-friendliness. Increase marketing and promotion of public transit. Expand transportation impact fee assessment. Implementing Agencies: San Francisco agencies: Muni, Planning Department, SF Environment, Department of Parking and Traffic Regional and other agencies: Metropolitan Transportation Agency, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, San Francisco Transportation Authority, BART, Caltrain, Golden Gate Transit, AC Transit, SamTrans, RIDES for Bay Area Commuters, San Francisco Water Transit Authority, Federal Transportation Authority Funding Sources: Proposition B Sales Tax Reauthorization, San Francisco Transportation Authority, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Federal Transportation Authority, CEMAQ, U.S. Congress Progress Indicator: Increase in the percentage of transit trips B. Ridesharing Encouraging carpooling and vanpooling will help to reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled by private cars and thereby reduce emissions. Many incentives for ridesharing exist in the Bay Area, such as High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes, preferential parking policies, and free passage across area toll bridges. RIDES for Bay Area Commuters also provides free ridematching services. However, most commuters still do not take advantage of these incentives, either because they do not know the incentives exist or they consider ridesharing to be bothersome. Further incentives to encourage ridesharing and increased outreach to potential carpool/vanpool participants will encourage others to switch. Next Steps: Designate more HOV lanes in the region. Expand carpool and vanpool designated parking at both municipal and private parking facilities. Require that all proposed large developments and existing public and private parking facilities in the City provide preferential parking for carpools and vanpools. Implement school ridesharing programs to reduce traffic around area schools. Increase marketing and promotion of ridesharing. Implementing Agencies: San Francisco agencies: Planning Department, SF Environment, Department of Parking and Traffic, San Francisco Unified School District Regional and other agencies: Metropolitan Transportation Commission, San Francisco Transportation Authority, RIDES for Bay Area Commuters, Caltrans Funding Sources: San Francisco Transportation Authority, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Federal Transportation Authority, Caltrans, Bay Area Air Quality Management District Progress Indicators: Increase in the number of miles of HOV lanes Increase in the percentage of carpool and vanpool trips Increase in the number of carpool and vanpool ridematches for San Francisco completed by RIDES for Bay Area Commuters Increase in the number of carpool/vanpool parking spaces at municipal and private parking lots High level of participation in school ridesharing program C. Bicycling and Walking San Francisco is well suited for bicycling and walking, and the city has a robust bicycle and pedestrian advocacy community that lobbies the City, State, and federal agencies to improve bicycle and pedestrian access. The lead City departments working on these issues-Parking and Traffic, Planning, and SF Environment-need to work more closely to further encourage the use of bicycle and pedestrian modes of transportation. A variety of measures, especially those that support safety and convenience, are essential to shift people from polluting motorized vehicles and toward the use of bicycles and sidewalks. Next Steps: Finish the bicycle network by continuing to increase the number of bicycle lanes, routes, and paths. Continue to improve safe access and passage on pedestrian walkways. Improve bicycle access to transit. Continue to improve and expand bicycle parking facilities. Increase workplace shower facilities for bicyclists. Increase marketing and promotion of bicycling. Implementing Agencies: San Francisco agencies: Planning Department, SF Environment, Department of Parking and Traffic, San Francisco Transportation Authority, Muni Regional and other agencies: Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Bay Area Air Quality Management District, RIDES for Bay Area Commuters, regional transit operators Funding Sources: San Francisco Transportation Authority, Bay Area Air Quality Management District, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Federal Transportation Authority Progress Indicators: Increase in the percentage of bicycle and walking trips Increase in the number of miles in the bicycle network D. Employer-Based Programs Employer-based strategies can be an effective way to reduce vehicle trips because a large percentage of trips are work-related and workers typically travel to the same place at about the same time every day, making it easier to find a practical substitute to driving. Employers are motivated to provide incentives for their workers as part of their overall benefits package to help attract and retain workers, and because of the increased worker productivity achieved through reduced commute time and related stress. Employer-based programs can include commuter tax benefits, parking cash-out, guaranteed ride home programs, shuttle to transit hubs, on-site services, telecommuting, and compressed work weeks. Next Steps: Implement mandatory employer trip-reduction requirements. Conduct general marketing and promotion of commuter services to stimulate employee demand for employer services. Expand employer commute assistance and outreach to assist employers in establishing and maintaining programs. Implement a countywide guaranteed ride home program to support the choice to use alternative modes of transportation to commute to work. Increase promotion of alternative modes to the 33,000 City and County employees and provide additional services and incentives. Implementing Agencies: San Francisco agencies: SF Environment, San Francisco Transportation Authority, San Francisco Board of Supervisors Regional and other agencies: RIDES for Bay Area Commuters, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Bay Area Air Quality Management District, private sector employers and business organizations Funding Sources: San Francisco Transportation Authority, Bay Area Air Quality Management District, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, U.S. EPA Progress Indicators: Increase in the percentage of all alternative modes combined for commute trips Increase in the number of employers required to provide trip reduction programs and incentives Increase in the number of employer contacts made by RIDES or other outreach staff High level of participation in a county-wide guaranteed ride home program Increase in the percentage of City employees using alternative modes for their commute E. Discourage Driving Another way to encourage a shift to alternative modes is to simply make driving more difficult or expensive. This can be accomplished through restrictions, as well as setting price signals. These types of strategies can be extremely effective, but also controversial. San Francisco already has experience with some conventional strategies, including bridge tolls, parking fees, and residential parking permits. Some potential strategies require implementation on the state or regional level, such as gas taxes or increasing vehicle license fees. Next Steps: Investigate congestion pricing on bridges or introduce cordon (controlled access) tolls for entrance into designated areas of the City. Lower minimum parking requirements or switch to parking maximums for all new developments. Reduce parking in areas well served by transit. Restrict the number of parking permits issued to the number of on-street spaces and consider charging market rates. Scale parking permit fees according to the number of vehicles in the household and/or vehicle size or emissions. Implementing Agencies: San Francisco Board of Supervisors, San Francisco Planning Department, San Francisco Department of Parking and Traffic Funding Sources: Department budgets, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Bay Area Air Quality Management District Progress Indicators: Decrease in traffic counts on area roadways Decrease in parking ratios in new developments Decrease in parking in areas well served by transit Decrease in the number of parking permits issued in the City F. Clean Air Vehicles and Fleet Efficiency Clean air vehicle and fleet efficiency strategies target the efficiency of the vehicles themselves, rather than trying to induce a shift to alternative modes. Improving Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) standards is one of the most direct and effective ways to reduce vehicle emissions. Others include switching to alternative fuels, installing emissions controls, and using advanced vehicle technologies such as electric batteries or fuel cells. Many of these strategies require action on the state and federal level to set policies, designate funding, and create incentives; however, some actions can be taken locally to support these efforts. Next Steps: Lobby for increased CAFE standards. Support state policies such as the LEV/ZEV sales mandate development of a greenhouse gas emission standard for all passenger vehicles and light duty trucks, and tiered registration fees based on vehicle size or emissions rather than cost. Introduce tiered parking rates based on vehicle size in privately owned parking facilities and City operated garages. Promote bridge toll and HOV lane waivers for AFVs. Lobby regional agencies to open clean vehicle grants for private sector uses so that public entities can implement projects targeting private sector fleets in their communities. Support the expansion of City Car Share to increase the accessibility and availability of this service throughout the City. Continue implementing San Francisco\\'s Environment Code, Chapter 4, purchasing AFVs for the City fleet and developing AFV fueling infrastructure in the community, facilitating conversion of private sector fleets, rightsizing and downsizing the City\\'s fleet, and creating carsharing vehicle pools. Replace old and highly polluting Muni buses with cleaner technologies. Develop a plan to encourage the county\\'s residents to purchase AFVs. Participate in fuel cell vehicle demonstration projects. Implementing Agencies: San Francisco agencies: Department of Administrative Services (City fleet operator), SF Environment, Board of Supervisors, Department of Parking and Traffic Other agencies: California State Legislature, California Air Resources Board (CARB), Bay Area Air Quality Management District, Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), private sector fleet operators Funding Sources: San Francisco Transportation Authority, Bay Area Air Quality Management District, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, U.S. EPA Progress Indicators: Increase in average vehicle fuel efficiency (reported annually by EPA) Creation of a state-wide greenhouse gas emissions standard Decrease in the number of large and/or inefficient vehicles registered in San Francisco Increase in the number of small, efficient, and/or alternative fuel vehicles registered Increase in the use of City Car Share vehicles Increase in the number/percentage of clean vehicles in the City fleet Increase in the percentage of clean air Muni vehicles Increase in the number of alternative fueling stations in the City with public access Increase in the number of private fleets implementing clean vehicle technology Implementation of fuel cell vehicle demonstration projects Energy Efficiency The energy sector accounts for approximately 50 percent of San Francisco\\'s CO2 emissions. Actions to improve energy efficiency in buildings include incentives, direct installation and technical assistance programs aimed at each of the major building sectors - residential, commercial, and municipal; education and outreach programs aimed at building users, operators, designers and builders; and legislation, codes and standards which support energy efficient design and practices. A. Incentives, Direct Installation and Technical Assistance Demand side management programs such as incentives, direct installation and technical assistance help utility customers install energy efficient equipment and to design and operate their homes, businesses and facilities more efficiently. These programs can include rebates, financing, energy surveys, design, engineering, expedited approval processes, project management assistance, and turnkey energy retrofit projects. Programs are available to each of the three major market sectors: residential, commercial, and municipal. Residential Buildings Public Goods Charge (PGC) funded multifamily and single-family residential demand side management programs should be continued and expanded. Next Steps: Continue implementation of SF Environment/PG&E Peak Energy Pilot (PEP) commercial programs. Develop agreements with organizations representing tenants, apartment owners, property managers, homeowners, and developers. Conduct bulk purchasing programs and trade-in events. Implement energy audit and retrofit programs for multi-family buildings with high energy use. Train contractors to test and retrofit residential buildings to improve program effectiveness. Obtain energy and peak load data to measure and evaluate progress. Establish a position in the Planning and Building Inspection departments for a specialist who will be responsible for providing advice and guidance on energy efficiency design, technologies, and incentives for new construction and remodeling projects submitted for permits. Implementing Agencies: PG&E, Department of Environment (SF Environment), Planning Department, Department of Building Inspection Funding Sources: Utility ratepayers (through Public Goods Charges), California Energy Commission (CEC), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Progress Indicators: Decreased demand (kilowatts) and energy use (kilowatt-hours, therms) Increased program participation rates Commercial Buildings Public Goods Charge (PGC) funded commercial demand side management programs should be continued and expanded. These programs should be customized for the San Francisco building stock. Next Steps: Continue implementation of SF Environment/PG&E Peak Energy Pilot (PEP) commercial programs. Develop agreements with local business organizations. Identify high-energy use buildings and businesses. Increase training of building operations and maintenance staff. Design and implement efficiency retrofit programs that include turnkey services. Promote peak load reduction and peak pricing tariffs. Obtain energy and peak load data to measure and evaluate progress. Implementing Agencies: PG&E, SF Environment Funding Sources: Utility ratepayers (through Public Goods Charges), CEC, DOE, EPA Progress Indicators: Decreased demand (kilowatts) and energy use (kilowatt-hours, therms) Increased program participation rates Municipal Buildings The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) implements projects in the public sector for Hetch Hetchy customers, which include City buildings and facilities such as fire stations, police stations, libraries, hospitals, sewage treatment facilities, convention centers, recreation centers, and San Francisco International Airport. Municipal energy efficiency and demand reduction programs should be continued and expanded. Next Steps: Design and implement comprehensive departmental energy efficiency programs at Muni, the Port, the Airport, SFPUC and other departments. Design and implement peak load management and demand response program in City facilities. Develop energy design review services for City departments. Integrate energy efficient equipment into City purchasing contracts. Provide energy efficiency training for building maintenance staff and conservation education for employees. Obtain energy use and peak load data to measure and evaluate progress. Implementing Agency: SFPUC Funding Sources: Hetch Hetchy Water and Power, departmental cost sharing, grants from state and federal agencies Progress Indicators: Decreased demand (kilowatts) and energy use (kilowatt-hours, therms) Increased program participation rates Number of staff trained Energy efficiency is integrated into standard operating procedures B. Education and Outreach Raising awareness about the benefits of energy efficiency, available programs, and energy efficient practices will enable residents, students, workers, and building owners to take action. Working with other agencies, the City can develop an energy efficiency education campaign to reach the general public, public and private school students, as well as building management and construction professionals. Next Steps: Set goals for public outreach to businesses and the community. Provide a single point of contact for information on programs (e.g. website/hotline). Establish a volunteer corps, and develop public education materials. Develop energy curricula for use in classrooms. Develop agreements with business and community organizations for the preparation and distribution of articles, mailings, and for energy information presentations. Develop agreements with local media to cover energy related events. Develop agreements with City departments to include energy messages in City mailings, in public facilities and on vehicles, and through normal City inspections. Identify local examples and prepare case studies of successful energy efficiency education actions. Develop an agreement with PG&E\\'s Pacific Energy Center to coordinate training for building management and construction professionals. Implementing Agencies: SF Environment, SF Unified School District, PG&E/Pacific Energy Center Funding Sources: Utility ratepayers, California Energy Commission, U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. EPA Progress Indicators: Number of Website hits and hotline contacts Number of participants trained C. Legislation, Codes and Standards Effective local legislation can reduce local energy use. The City can adopt codes and standards to improve the efficiency of existing residential, commercial and municipal buildings, and can require new construction to be more energy efficient than the current state standards. Next Steps: Develop energy guidelines for an amendment to the Rent Stabilization Act to allow landlords to pass through to tenants the cost of reasonable energy efficiency or renewable energy investments. Amend the Residential Energy Conservation Ordinance (RECO) to increase the efficiency of existing housing. Reinstate the City\\'s Commercial Energy Conservation Ordinance (CECO). Develop new requirements for energy efficient operations and maintenance practices in large commercial properties including requirements for the installation of efficient lighting system demand management controls. Develop ordinances to require improved efficiency in new multi-family construction and existing housing. Enforce the Green Building Ordinance requiring energy efficient equipment, building commissioning, and LEED green building certification in municipal facilities. Implementing Agencies: SF Environment, SFPUC, City Attorney Funding Sources: City and state funds and other grants Progress Indicators: Enforcement reports show high level of compliance Energy usage reports show decreased demand (kilowatts) and energy use (kilowatt-hours, therms) Number of buildings obtaining LEED silver certification Renewable Energy Replacing fossil fuel energy with clean renewable energy resources such as solar, wind and biomass reduces local greenhouse gas emissions. San Francisco has voiced strong support for renewable energy through the City\\'s Sustainability Plan, the Electricity Resource Plan, and the passage of ballot measures authorizing debt financing of renewable energy projects and energy efficiency measures. Developing both large and small-scale renewable energy projects requires: assessing resource potential and costs, identifying appropriate sites, developing financing mechanisms, and developing business, labor and consumer demand and support. A. Renewable Energy Projects Solar Energy Maximizing the development of solar energy in San Francisco will require a coordinated effort to facilitate installation of solar photovoltaic systems on commercial, residential and municipal facilities in the City. To this end, SFPUC and SF Environment are jointly implementing the Generation Solar Program. Next Steps: Identify high value sites for solar projects (e.g. roofs with proper orientation). Create transparency in specifications and prices for solar electric technology. Catalogue and publicize financing options for consumers. Assist in matching solar early adopters with qualified installers. Provide training for solar installation and appropriate linkages with labor organizations. Reduce city permit fees and streamline permit process. Encourage studies of benefits and costs to local electricity distribution system of large-scale distributed generation installations. Troubleshoot grid interconnection process with PG&E. Develop a business plan to enable Hetch Hetchy power operation to issue solar revenue bonds. Facilitate access to customer incentives and low-interest financing. Implementing Agencies: SFPUC, SF Environment Funding Sources: SFPUC, debt financing authorized through Proposition B and H, private financing, grants and loans from state and federal agencies Progress Indicators: Increased energy generated by renewable resources (kilowatt-hours) Increased number of solar projects installed Wind Energy Develop and install wind projects within and outside of San Francisco. Next Steps: Continue to monitor the wind resources within San Francisco and on City-owned property outside the City limits (e.g. Hunters Point Shipyard, Crystal Springs). Develop and apply models to quantify the value of energy storage capabilities of the hydroelectric system for adding value to intermittent renewable energy generation such as wind. Develop an RFP for 50 megawatts of wind generation to supplement Hetch Hetchy power after the expiration of the Calpine contract. Research small-scale wind generators appropriate for urban use. Research feasibility of a pilot offshore wind generation capability. Investigate benefits of entering into a power purchase contract for new wind generation to take advantage of project tax benefits and reduce city risk. Implementing Agencies: SFPUC and SF Environment Funding Sources: Financing from Proposition B or H revenue bonds Financing through a project developer supported by a power purchase contract Federal production tax credits State and federal grant funds Progress Indicators: Installed capacity (kilowatts) and energy production (kilowatt-hours) Number of sites monitored Biomass Energy Sewage treatment biogas can be collected for use in combustion generators to generate electricity. Next Steps: Assess new opportunities for expanding biogas generation at existing City wastewater treatment facilities. Identify opportunities for gasification of biomass waste materials for use in modular generation technologies such as fuel cells. Implementing Agency: SFPUC Funding Sources: SFPUC, Proposition B & H revenue bonds, State and federal grant funds Progress Indicator: Installed capacity (kilowatts) and energy production (kilowatt-hours) B. Emerging Technologies Emerging new renewable technologies include hydrogen, fuel cells, tidal current and offshore wave energy generation. The City should assess the resource potential and feasibility for these technologies in San Francisco, and develop partnerships with appropriate agencies to implement demonstration projects. Hydrogen Fuel Cells Next Steps: Site and install 2 proton exchange membrane fuel cells obtained as part of a grant award from the Department of Energy. Implement an \"energy station\" hybrid fuel cell demonstration project to provide hydrogen for stationary and vehicle fuel cells. Develop hydrogen educational materials for schools. Develop network of City staff to champion hydrogen projects. Present workshop for policymakers. Implementing Agencies: SFPUC, SF Environment Progress Indicators: Completed demonstration projects Number of classrooms with educational materials Tidal Power Next steps Initiate feasibility study on electricity generation from the current flow through San Francisco Bay. Create an intra-agency action team to steer a pilot project. Develop the pilot project. Report on findings. Conduct community education and outreach. Implementing Agency: SF Environment Funding Sources: Grants from state and federal agencies (e.g. CEC, DOE) and foundations Project financing with manufacturer or developer Progress Indicators: Feasibility study findings and recommendations Completed demonstration project C. Green Power Purchasing Existing renewables currently make up approximately 11% of the state power grid. Strategies for increasing this percentage are to create a market for renewable resources and create requirements for the development of those resources. The City should support opportunities for City residents, businesses, and municipal facilities to purchase electricity generated from renewable energy resources - \"green power\". Next Steps: Evaluate community choice aggregation for a citywide power purchasing pool, as approved under Assembly Bill 117. Support accelerated implementation of the state\\'s Renewable Portfolio Standard. Support legislation that would allow solar generation on city facilities that export power to the grid to be compensated for those power exports. Implementing Agency: SFPUC Funding Sources: SFPUC Progress Indicator: Megawatt-hours of renewable energy purchased Solid Waste Recycling has the dual benefits of reducing landfill and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Expansion of citywide recycling and composting programs in the residential and commercial sectors, increased construction and demolition waste recycling, and increased source reduction and recycling in municipal buildings will move San Francisco towards achieving its 75% landfill diversion goal as well as its greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. A. Residential Recycling and Composting Increasing diversion of residential waste from the landfill will require expanding residential recycling programs, including all types of paper, cardboard, glass, metal and plastic containers, wood, film plastic and other common household materials. The City should increase outreach, serve apartment buildings, add new materials to recycle and adopt mandatory polices which will result in substantial increases in diversion of residential recyclable material. Next Steps: Expand recycling and composting services for the City\\'s apartment buildings, particularly for the 133,000 units in buildings that house 6 units or more. Develop equivalent collection services for downtown areas. Increase participation through expanded outreach. Add new materials to residential diversion programs. Adopt policies for mandatory participation. Develop waste diversion strategies and programs with the City\\'s Environmental Justice Program to better serve SF Housing Authority and other low-income housing. Promote building owner/manager and resident participation in waste diversion programs. Implementing Agencies: SF Environment, Norcal Waste Systems, Inc. Funding Sources: Garbage Ratepayers, California Department of Conservation Progress Indicator: Tons of waste diverted from landfill B. Commercial Recycling and Composting Recyclable material diversion can be greatly increased by expand commercial recycling programs, including all types of paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastic, wood, light metals, film plastic and other common industrial materials. Similarly, compostable material diversion can be increased by expanding commercial organics collection and composting programs through outreach, by requiring use of compostable products and by adopting mandatory policies. Continuing and expanding these programs will result in substantial increases in diversion of commercial recyclable material from the landfill. Next Steps: Complete commercial recycling and composting collection programs rollout per garbage rate plan. Target generators, conduct waste audits, provide training and other assistance, and collaborate with associations (e.g., BOMA, restaurant and hotel associations), service providers, unions and others to increase diversion. Expand outreach, including promote participation in waste diversion programs by building owners/managers and employees. Monitor new organics processing, Pier 96 commercial recycling lines and Tunnel Avenue construction and demolition debris lines to ensure they are being used to their fullest capacity. Develop markets, add materials eligible for recycling and composting collection, and promote buying recycled. Integrate environmental justice considerations into commercial waste diversion program plans. Provide incentives (such as tiered rates, awards programs) for increased participation. Research and recommend legislation to increase diversion. Implementing Agencies: SF Environment, Norcal Waste Systems, Inc. Funding Sources: Garbage Ratepayers, California Department of Conservation Progress Indicator: Tons of waste diverted from landfill C. Construction and Demolition Debris Recycling Construction and Demolition (C&D) debris represents a significant portion of the waste stream in San Francisco, up to 20% depending on materials included. Increasing C&D diversion will therefore have a great impact on overall solid waste reduction. Next Steps: Complete Norcal\\'s new Materials Recovery Facility and monitor operations to expand capacity for C&D diversion. Expand outreach, including promote participation in waste diversion programs by building owners/managers and contractors. Develop new markets for C&D waste (e.g. sheetrock). Develop policies for mandatory participation (e.g. C&D debris recycling ordinance). Implementing Agencies: SF Environment, Norcal Waste Systems Inc., Specialty Crushing Funding Sources: Building owners and contractors Progress Indicator: Tons of waste diverted from landfill D. Alternate Collection Methods A number of recycling programs do not fall under Norcal\\'s programs or other processing programs. These include donations at community recycling centers, buy-back of California Redemption Value (CRV) beverage containers, and numerous collection programs operated by non-profit organizations or independent companies such as paper dealers; re-use centers like Goodwill for furniture and textiles; and electronic waste reuse and recycling. Developing new programs in this area that will result in increases in diversion of materials in this group. Next Steps: Provide technical assistance and financial support (e.g., grants and contracts) to organizations to increase waste prevention, reuse, recycling and composting diversion. Expand outreach to support these programs. Implementing Agencies: SF Environment, Norcal Waste Systems, Inc., private recyclers (e.g., Circosta Iron and Metals) and non- profit recyclers (e.g., San Francisco Community Recyclers) Funding Sources: Garbage Ratepayers, California Department of Conservation Progress Indicator: Tons of waste diverted from landfill E. Source Reduction, Reuse and Other Waste Prevention Encourage producers to be responsible for the waste associated with the products they manufacture and distribute - during production, packaging and at the end of the product\\'s life. Increase the recyclability or compostability of selected product types and secure producer participation and/or funding to collect and divert them from landfill. Next Steps: Increase waste audits as a step to increasing waste prevention. Work with other cities, counties and stakeholders to enact State electronics producer responsibility legislation. Identify additional reusable, recyclable and compostable products with recycled content, direct purchases to such alternatives, and evaluate buying recycled progress. Research and recommend local packaging producer responsibility legislation. Increase outreach (e.g. brochures, media campaigns, grants) and assistance to businesses and purchasers on purchasing and using recycled and/or recyclable/compostable products. Research and promote using products that require less materials (e.g. double sided copying). Implementing Agencies: SF Environment, Norcal Waste Systems, Inc. and other organizations (e.g., and San Francisco League of Urban Gardeners) Funding Sources: Garbage Ratepayers, California Department of Conservation, California Integrated Waste Management Board Progress Indicator: Increased tons of waste diverted from landfill F. Municipal Programs By minimizing purchase of products made from virgin materials and maximize those that are recyclable or compostable, City government diversion can be increased from an estimated 40% to more than 50% by 2005. Next Steps: Update City department database, conduct waste audits at each location, provide training and other assistance, collaborate with service providers, unions and others, and evaluate Resource Conservation Ordinance compliance. Strengthen Resource Conservation Ordinance to increase City departments\\' diversion programs and purchases of recycled content products (e.g. post consumer content paper) and compostables (e.g. food service products). Climate Action Plan Provide technical assistance (e.g. training for city staff to participate in programs). Implementing Agencies: SF Environment, Norcal Waste Systems, Inc.

       "    'text': 'Homeless people are frequently approached by police in public spaces. 74% of respondents reported being approached by police in a public space in the last year. 20% of respondents reported being approached four or more times in the past month. 12% of respondents reported being approached at least twice a week throughout the year. Homeless people are forced to move by law enforcement for being in public even when they have no other alternatives. 70% of respondents had been forced to move from a public space. For those forced to move, homelessness and housing status proved significant. In the past year 93% of those camping, 88% residing on the streets, 80% residing in vehicles, 72% staying with friends and families, 61% of those in shelter, and 55% of those currently in a residential hotel had been forced to move from public space. Anti-homeless laws are ineffective in moving homeless people out of public space or prohibiting targeted \"criminal\" activities such as sitting, standing, or sleeping. When respondents were asked to move from a public space, 70% of the time they simply moved down the street or around the corner, stayed in the same spot, or walked around to return after the police had left. 1 UC Berkeley Law School Policy Advocacy Clinic. California\\'s New Vagrancy Laws: The Growing Enactment and Enforcement of Anti-Homeless Laws in the Golden State (2015). 2 Bruce Western. Punishment and inequality in America (Russell Sage Foundation, 2006). 22% of respondents moved to a different neighborhood when they were asked to move. However, the survey results showed that their was no unidirectional pattern, but rather a churning between neighborhoods and police districts. Only 9% of respondents reported that they moved indoors the last time they were forced to move. Police interactions do not result in connection to services. The SFPD is far and away the largest displacer-accounting for 84% of displacements, 204 of the 244 most recent displacements reported by respondents. Services or even information on services were rarely offered by the SFPD. Only 24 out of the 204 respondents who reported being forced to move were offered services-most often a pamphlet, shelter bed, or sandwich. Most homeless respondents were searched by police in the past year. 56% of respondents reported having been searched while homeless. 21% reported that they had been searched within the month. 46% of respondents reported having their belongings taken by City officials while homeless and 38% reported having belongings destroyed by City officials. \"Quality of life\" citations affected the majority of homeless respondents. 69% of respondents were cited in the past year. 22% of respondents received more than five citations in the past year. 90% of respondents were unable to pay the fine for their last citation. Due to non-payment, 68% of respondents reported that they were not able to pay their last citation. In San Francisco this results in a $300 civil assessment fee being added to the base fine, an arrest warrant, and suspicion of one\\'s driver\\'s license. Respondents noted that citations create barriers to exiting homelessness, negatively affecting access to jobs, housing, and services. Most \"quality of life\" citations in San Francisco are aimed at activities associated with homelessness. Between October 2006 and March 2014, the SFPD issued 51,757 citations for \"quality of life crimes,\" of which over 22,000 were for sleeping, sitting, or begging. More citations were given for sleeping and sitting than any other prohibited activities categorized as \"quality of life\" between 2007-2013. Enforcement is increasingly aimed at sleeping, sitting, and begging, accounting for 70% of all \"quality of life\" citations in 2013 (the last year in which records were kept.) Citations for anti-homeless offenses have increased over threefold since 2011. Citations for anti-homeless laws are on the rise. Parks citations for sleeping and camping have grown sixfold from 165 citations to 963 between 2011 and 2014. SFPD citations for sleeping, sitting, and begging increased threefold from 1,231 tickets in 2011 to 3,350 in 2013. Incarceration perpetuates homelessness. 59% of respondents had been incarcerated in SF County Jail or California State Prison during their life and 44% of respondents had experienced multiple incarcerations, mainly in the last three years. 11% of respondents reported that they had been housed at the time of their most recent arrest, and became homeless upon release from jail or prison. An estimated 25% of San Franciscans on probation are homeless. 81% of respondents were not offered any services upon their most recent release from jail or prison. Of the 19% who were offered services, the most common were, in order: a pamphlet, a bus ticket, a shelter bed, or access to a housing wait list. Criminalization disproportionately affected people of color, gender non-conforming people, and those with mental illness. People of color were approached more frequently by police: 81% of Black respondents and 84% of Latino, Native American and other non-Asian respondents of color had been approached by police, compared to 77% of white respondents and 69% of Asian respondents. Black respondents reported the highest rate of past incarceration: 74% of Black respondents had been incarcerated, compared to 51% of white respondents. Forced displacement from public space disproportionately threatened the safety of gender non-conforming people who participated in this study: 59% of gender non-conforming participants felt less safe after they were forced to move. Those who identified as having mental disabilities reported higher rates of being approached by the police (+10%) and higher rates of failure to address citations (+10%).',\n",

       "    'text': 'San Francisco\\'s last point-in-time count found more homeless men than women. 69% of homeless people counted in San Francisco\\'s last point-in-time count were men; 27% were women, and 3% were transgender.118 29% of respondents to San Francisco\\'s last point-in-time survey identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, compared to 15% of San Francisco\\'s general population. LGBT respondents were more likely to have had \"frequent episodes\" of homelessness in the past year.119 Groups that are over-represented in the homeless population are the most vulnerable to policing in public space. Women who participated in our study were arrested and incarcerated at much higher rates than women in the general population: While only 1 in 56 women (1 in 19 Black women and 1 in 118 white women) will be incarcerated in their lifetimes,120 64% of Black women (N = 22) and 45% of white women (N =22) who participated in our survey had been incarcerated. While our sample is not representative of the homeless population and results are not gen-eralizable, the data show a strong relationship between race, homelessness and incarceration for our participants. Compared to men, women who participated in this study reported lower frequencies of search, citation and incarceration. However, the experience of being searched, cited, and displaced was qualitatively different, and often violent, for many women and gender non-conforming participants. When police or other city officials forced homeless survey participants to move, they most often moved only a short distance or temporarily. While most survey participants felt the same after moving to a new location, a large number also felt \"less safe.\" This is because moving from a familiar location to an unfamiliar location often increases vulnerability to violence. Gender non-conforming people most frequently reported feeling \"less safe\" after city officials forced them to move to a new location. Whereas 30% of survey participants overall reported feeling less safe when being forced to move, 59% of gender non-conforming participants felt less safe after they were forced to move. Many women and gender non-conforming people told interviewers that they felt more vulnerable sleeping outdoors after being forced to move from a familiar location. Sindi, a 57-year-old white transgender woman, explained: \"You could sleep with one eye open and be safe. But there\\'s some of us who can\\'t sleep like that... Night is when the predators come out.\" Although we did not ask about experiences of sexual violence, two women participants told interviewers that they were raped when they ended up in an unfamiliar location after police forced them to move. Trans people and the criminalization of homelessness Nationally, transgender people and especially transgender women of color, experience homelessness at higher rates than other groups. This is due to pervasive housing and employment discrimination, and family rejection. Trans people are an estimated four times more likely to have a household income below $10,000 than the general population. 19% of participants in a national survey of 6,450 transgender people said they became homeless as a result of anti-transgender bias or discrimination and eleven percent reported that they had been evicted due to their gender identity.121 One out of five transgender Californians in a separate survey experienced homelessness after they first identified as transgender.122 The rate of homelessness among trans people is estimated to be over 2.5 times higher than the lifetime rate of homelessness in the general population (7.4%). Black transgender and 118 This is likely an undercount. See Mona Chalabi \"Why We Don\\'t Know the Size of the Transgender Population,\" FiveThirtyEight, July 29, 2014. 119 Applied Survey Research, supra note 6. 120 The Sentencing Project, \"Incarcerated Women Factsheet,\" (September, 2012). 121 Jaime M. Grant et al., supra note 103. 122 Transgender Law Center. The State of Transgender California (2008). gender non-conforming people reported that they were currently homeless at the highest rate (13%), compared to other racial groups. Many gender non-conforming people also reported being marginally housed: 26% of all trans respondents, and 48% of Black trans respondents in the national survey had experienced housing instability during the past year.123 With nowhere to go and a high likelihood of encountering anti-trans harassment or violence, trans people who end up on the street are likely to interact with police in public space. Sixteen percent of respondents to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey spent time in jail or prison \"for any reason,\" and seven percent of transgender respondents had been arrested and incarcerated \"strictly due to bias of police officers on the basis of gender identity/expression.\" 47% of Black trans respondents to the national survey and 30% of Native American respondents reported past incarceration, along with 21% of all trans women and 10% of trans men who participated in the survey. These rates of incarceration greatly exceed those of other demographic groups. Trans people are often mis-gendered in jails and prisons, so there is no official source of data on the number of transgender people who are incarcerated. However, the results of this national survey indicate that transgender people are particularly vulnerable to getting caught in a cycle of homelessness and incarceration. Transgender participants in our Coalition on Homelessness survey told interviewers that they felt law enforcement targeted them due to their gender identity, their status as homeless or marginally housed, and-for trans women of color-their race. Beti, a 75-year-old transgender man said: \"Being gay and identifying as trans affects me greatly. When I interact with police, they automatically address the situation, \\'Man up. Take care of your own problem...\\' They don\\'t treat me as much as a second class citizen as not a citizen at all... an alien.\" Sindi, a 57-year-old white transgender woman explained: \"Cops harass me. I think it\\'s none of their business, but they want to pull up and harass me, because I\\'m transgender...Being poor, they treat you with no respect at all, because they think you have no human rights at all. I had more contact with cops after I became homeless.\" People of color and gender non-conforming people are over-represented in the homeless population. Homeless people of color are disproportionately disadvantaged by the use of bail, court-imposed debt, and unavoidable probation violations due to homeless status. Respondents who were members of these groups reported frequent and negative interactions with police. In order to mitigate these effects, we have included recommendations at the end of this section.',\n",

Anti-Homeless Ordinances: Laws that prohibit life-sustaining activities that homeless people have little choice but to undertake in public: (1) standing, sitting, and resting in public spaces, including loitering and \"vagrancy\" (daytime restrictions); (2) sleeping, camping, and lodging including in vehicles (nighttime restrictions); (3) begging and panhandling; (4) and food sharing. Quality of Life Ordinances: Low-level non-violent crimes of activities frequently considered nuisances and are mainly intended to regulate \"uncivil behavior\" and \"public disorder\" in public spaces. These include the various anti-homeless laws, but also restrictions on drinking in public, dogs not leashed, climbing trees, smoking in parks, littering, or unlicensed vending among others. Because \"quality of life\" laws mainly prohibit activities that would be non-criminal were they to occur on private property or within one\\'s home, those experiencing homelessness are disproportionately impacted, if not discriminately targeted in their enforcement. Disproportional Impact: The ways by which homeless people are put at a disadvantage within the criminal justice system compared to those who are housed or are of higher-class status. This includes police harassment and citation of anti-homeless laws and quality of life ordinances, but also arrest, detention, conviction, sentencing, and experiences on probation and parole. 7\"Quality of Life\" Laws Anti-homeless laws are part and parcel of a wider set of ordinances and criminal justice paradigm both commonly and officially referred to as \"quality of life\" ordinances or \"civility laws.\" These laws refer to activities frequently considered nuisances, and are mainly intended to regulate \"disorder\" in public spaces. This set of regulations includes the various anti-homeless laws prohibiting sitting, sleeping, and eating, but also restrictions on drinking in public, dogs not leashed, climbing trees, smoking in parks, littering, or unlicensed vending among others. While the courts, San Francisco Police Department, Human Services Agency, and other departments in San Francisco have varying classifications of what constitutes a \"quality of life violation,\" by any definition there are dozens of such laws. Because \"quality of life\" laws mainly prohibit activities that would be non-criminal were they to occur on private property or within one\\'s home, those experiencing homelessness are disproportionately impacted and withstand discrimination in enforcement. This report refers to the term in quotes throughout, because it is an offensive misnomer that refers to the \"quality of life\" of one group at the detriment to the quality of life of others-namely poor people, people of color, and homeless people who are disproportionately impacted by these laws. This distinction is made explicitly clear by the San Francisco Police Department itself, whose primary webpage dedicated to homelessness is entitled \"Quality of Life / Homelessness: Interacting with the Homeless Community.\"13 Initially, \"quality of life\" was a popular term of urban policy to reference the needs of the poor.14 The newly founded Federal Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HUD) entitled the guide to its first major initiative, the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Act of 1966, \"Improving the Quality of Urban Life.\" Lyndon B. Johnson frequently used the term in promoting his War on Poverty. It was only after a backlash against liberal programs, and co-opting of the term by middle class neighborhood councils, that \"quality of life\" came to be associated with policing rather than welfare, and refer to middle and upper classes rather than the poor. The political and policing concept of \"quality of life\" as we now know it, first emerged in New York City in 1981 when Mayor Koch outlined \"quality of life\" Enforcement in his annual mayoral report as efforts to keep streets clean, reduce canine waste, and increased enforcement against street drug dealers. However, it wasn\\'t until the early 1990s that \"quality of life\" laws and their zero-tolerance policing came fully into fruition as a common political and policing strategy calling for the aggressive enforcement of minor crimes in Mayor Giuliani and police chief William Bratton\\'s New York. It rapidly spread across the entire country, and was famously imported to San Francis-co by Mayor, and former police chief, Frank Jordan. From a policing perspective, the idea is that if a neighborhood is able to enforce behavior standards against minor disorders, more serious problems will be unlikely to develop.15 Quality of life policing was also promoted through claims that catching offenders jumping turnstiles or jaywalking would more quickly expose those with warrants and that by picking up low-level drug-dealers you may also be taking off the streets a potential violent offender.16 Social scientists have largely discredited the effectiveness of the policing strategy,17 but from a political perspective, \"quality of life\" campaigns remain hugely successful in attracting voters, businesses, and donors with the promises of a \"higher quality of life, a cleaner city, a better city, that draws more business and has more jobs.\"18 The emphasis is always on the fate of both middle-class neighborhoods and business, while homeless people are to be swept up for the benefit of the rest of the city. 13 San Francisco Police Department Website: http://sf-police.org/index.aspx?page=4441. 14 For a historical overview of the term and effects of \"quality of life\" see the book by former SF Coalition Civil Rights Organizer, now CUNY Professor Alex Vitale.

Whatever offenses they may have committed, the trajectory of those incarcerated cannot be mapped out and explained without considering social class.21 Two-thirds of people in U.S. jails had an income of less than $12,000 the year prior to arrest.22 The arrest, detention, conviction, and sentencing of a person are all better explained by class position than a seriousness of crimes, and those experiencing homelessness are disadvantage at each step in the system. Homeless people are more prone to arrest, not only because of the special anti-homeless and quality-of-life provisions designed to entangle them, but also because they tend to reside in poor neighborhoods that experience higher levels of policing, are caught on drug offenses that the housed so easily avoid, and are frequently approached and searched due to complaints against their very presence.23 Once detained, they cannot afford even the lowest level of bail and are therefore held for weeks or months at the city\\'s expense. In San Francisco 85% of the roughly 1,3000 inmates have not been convicted of anything, and are there because they simply cannot afford bail-a large portion unable to afford the lowest $500 bail.24 The promise of escaping jail quickly leads many to accept a conviction, while those who go to trial cannot afford a private attorney. Not only is a homeless person\\'s conviction in trial more likely, due to their inability to attain legal resources, their sentencing may also be harsher due to their previous record of \"quality-of-life\" offenses or the disproportionate sentencing associated with poor people\\'s 19 US Bureau of Justice Statistics, Correctional Populations in the United States, 2013.

If a homeless person avoids incarceration and is placed on probation, the restrictions on curfew, of avoiding to particular parts of town, and dis-associating with other parolees and former felons is made virtually impossible by their homeless status. Those experiencing homelessness are disproportionately affected by the war on drugs, tougher sentencing laws, and zero-tolerance policing and are disadvantaged in every step of the penal system, from arrest to sentencing to probation. At the same time, the criminal justice system produces homelessness through detaining poor people who are housed prior to arrest and in the course of a few months or years graduates them into homelessness with a certified criminal record and no viable housing option upon release.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Distinctive neighborhoods are one of San Francisco\\'s defining amenities. Whereas many large metropolises feature districts with differing cultural or architectural identities, San Francisco\\'s compact size combined with its varied topography has created a great number of \"cities in a city.\" The Sunset and Parkside Districts are often ignored in the discussion of diverse and interesting neighborhoods of San Fran-cisco. Perhaps the assembly-line style of construction that created the majority of the housing stock, combined with the neighborhood\\'s reputation as the city\\'s \"bedroom community,\" give the impression of a bland, homogenous suburb. To balance this characterization, in recent years community groups such as SPEAK (Sunset Parkside Education and Action Committee), the Ocean Beach Historical Society, and the Western Neighborhoods Project have fostered new appreciation of the Sunset\\'s varied architecture and individual neighborhoods. As with much of San Francisco\\'s history, the Parkside District had its share of entrepreneurial vision, scandals, circumstantial setbacks, and community leaders. The city grew into one of the world\\'s most popular destinations and the Parkside developed into a attractive home for a major city\\'s middle class families. Parkside residents always recognized that they lived in a unique San Francisco neighborhood, even if the boundaries weren\\'t always obvious. The Parkside may be part of the Sunset District, but it has a distinguished past and, as the neighborhood moves into its second century, perhaps a distinctive future. 53',\n",

City of Jacksonville which held a vagrancy ordinance unconstitutionally vague: it failed to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that \"vagrancy\" was forbidden and \"encouraged arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions.\" The Court also worried that law enforcement officials could use the law against undesired groups as a \"convenient tool for \\'harsh and discriminatory enforcement.\\'\"10 Today\\'s anti-homeless laws are mainly inventions of the 1980s, as a crisis response to the unprecedented explosion of homelessness caused by the drastic reduction in affordable housing in the Federal budget.11 Since then, these laws have become increasingly widespread, and continue to proliferate at unprecedented rates across the US, growing most rapidly in the past five years. More narrowly tailored than the earlier vagrancy ordinances, today\\'s anti-homeless laws are aimed at particular behaviors (sleeping, sitting, begging) in particular places (near ATMs, on sidewalks, in parks), at particular times (7 a.m.-9 p.m., 9 p.m.-7 a.m.), to avoid the constitutional limits imposed on broad vagrancy laws.',\n",

Despite some long term shifts in proportional shares, San Francisco's racial and ethnic composition remains diverse. The City's Asian population is growing steadily but the number of Black residents continues to drop. San Franciscans of Latin or Hispanic origin are also increasing, although not at rates seen at state or national levels. San Franciscans are also getting older, with a median age of 38.2 years. There are more children under 5 years old but San Francisco continues to be in the top three of major cities with the fewest children. The numbers of older San Franciscans are growing as well. Family households are increasing but there are also more single-person households. Our citizens are also better educated: a third of San Franciscans over 25 years old have earned a B.A. diploma and about one in five hold a graduate or professional degree. Median incomes rose, although once adjusted for inflation, are almost unchanged from 2000. More employed San Franciscans are taking transit to work. Commuting by car has dropped and other travel to work modes such as biking and walking are becoming more popular. Working at home is also increasing. A growing number of San Francisco households are car-free. San Francisco is a city of neighborhoods, diverse in composition and character.

       "    'text': \" In an open-ended question that asked what additional public or private resources are required to meet the city's current unmet need for services to veterans, nearly all of the cities that responded called for more affordable housing. Several cities also highlighted the need for supportive services. Among their specific suggestions: Boston: Definitely needed are supportive housing resources for veterans who served in the military but are not VA-eligible. Comprehensive education, employment and training, job development, and transitional employment stipends are needed for veterans needing to re-tool for the domestic job market. Mental health and substance abuse treatment are needed for veterans with behavioral health issues. Also, flexible funds are needed for chronically homeless and other veterans moving from the streets and shelters into housing, for things such as furniture, beds, etc. Charleston: More permanent housing for veterans experiencing homelessness would help our community better meet the need. This could come in the form of VASH supportive housing, or simply more available affordable housing. Cleveland: Additional low-income rental housing subsidies are needed to end veterans' homelessness. Des Moines: Needed is affordable housing where substance and mental health issues and non-payment will not result in eviction. Los Angeles: More resources for Permanent Supportive Housing with an emphasis on project-based housing for veterans are needed. Also needed are wrap-around supportive services to help re-integrate veterans into society. Individuals increase recovery from chronic health, mental health, and substance abuse challenges when they have the stability of a permanent home. The effective solution is rapid placement in affordable rental housing in the community, with linkages to supportive services. Louisville: The number of VASH vouchers used for supportive housing should be increased. In addition, more programs to serve homeless offenders (including sex offenders) are needed. Nashville: Our most-needed resource continues to be adequate, safe, clean, affordable housing units for homeless veterans. Meaningful employment with a living wage also is needed for vets, as are more mental health resources, including non-VA clinicians who can diagnose PTSD. Norfolk: We need additional VASH and housing choice vouchers, increased SSVF, and grant funding to support veterans' initiatives. Philadelphia: We need affordable housing and permanent supportive housing (VASH), including housing for those with criminal histories; services, particularly intensive case management (ACT team) and navigator services to connect veterans with housing opportunities and assist with housing retention; and furniture or a furniture bank. Phoenix: Funding for non-VASH veterans and for the SSVF program are needed. Providence: Expansion of outreach efforts targeted to veterans is needed. We also could use more effective measures to identify those veterans who have not identified themselves as veterans to homeless service agencies. Saint Paul: There is an ongoing need for more supportive housing for all residents, including homeless veterans. Salt Lake City: We need continued partnerships with the VA and service providers. San Antonio: There is a need for more affordable permanent housing, especially for veterans with families. San Francisco: The biggest challenge is the very costly and competitive rental market. More affordable housing for all segments of the population is needed. Santa Barbara: More affordable housing with supportive services is needed.\",\n",

These are contractual obligations, not affected by the ruling on California\\'s source of income statute, Sabi v. Sterling, No. B205279 (Cal. Ct. App. Apr.8, 2010), which rejected a Section 8 tenant\\'s source of income discrimination claim when her landlord refused to accept her Section 8 voucher to help pay her rent after her husband passed away. The court held that the California Fair Employment and Housing Act\\'s \"source of income\" discrimination provision does not protect tenants against discrimination based on their participation in the Section 8 Voucher program, finding that Section 8 vouchers do not constitute income for the purposes of the statute. This ruling places California law at odds with that of other states. It is an open question as to whether this ruling preempts local law. 131 29 Hous.

According to Olson Lee, the Director of the Mayor\\'s Office of Housing and former SFRA Deputy Director for Housing, the public land trust \"avoids ever having to do it again, since we had to do it once...This will always be affordable housing and will always serve San Francisco in that way.\" Lee interview, July 25, 2012. 133 San Francisco: A City Committed to Preservation, Policy Link case study. The SFRA Housing Preservation Program relies on public/private collaboration and an inclusive process that encourages participation from banks, tenant advocates and non-profit housing agencies. The program has three primary components: education and outreach to tenants, regulatory and legislative advocacy, and facilitation of private property ownership to non-profits or cooperatives that will result in long-term affordability.128 The Rent Control Ordinance was amended to apply to any formerly HUD-assisted property occupied before 1979 that emerges from the federal program,129 ensuring that the affordable subsidized rents remain the base rents for the now unrestricted property, and discrimination based on source of income is prohibited, preventing owners from refusing to accept rent vouchers.130 Tax increment funds grants and below-market loans are provided for nonprofit purchasers and pre-development assistance.131 A public land trust model has been used in most cases, whereby the land is purchased by the Redevelopment Agency and leased to the owners of the improvements for use as affordable housing for up to 99 years.132 The success of a program like this depends upon supportive local ordinances, financial assistance for tenant organizing and capacity building, substantial local financing, and the effective use of other fiscal resources for acquisition and renovation purposes.133',\n",

       "    'text': 'Being forced to move from public spaces and being given multiple citations was a common occurrence for homeless respondents. In addition, 59% of the survey respondents reported being arrested and incarcerated at some point in their lives. As discussed in the previous sections, homeless people are more likely to be arrested because of numerous factors. Specifically, homeless people are often in poor neighborhoods with higher levels of policing caught in personal possession of drugs with greater frequency than those who use drugs in their own homes targeted by special anti-homeless and \"quality of life\" provi- sions designed to entangle them frequently searched and approached due to complaints against their very presence. We found that the majority-59%-of survey respondents had experienced incarceration, and that 44% had been incarcerated multiple times, with their most recent incarceration having occurred within the last three years. While surveyors did not ask respondents about the reasons for their arrests or incarcerations, we can infer from statistics on arrest and incarceration statewide and in San Francisco that the vast majority were for non-violent, poverty-related offenses.82 Nearly 6,500 arrests in the state of California are attributable to anti-homeless laws. 83 Most homeless respondents to the last point-in-time survey who had been incarcerated reported that they were in jail for five days or less. The short duration of incarceration means that most homeless people who are in jail are there simply because they are too poor to afford bail. The San Francisco Public Defender reports: \"85% of the roughly 1,300 inmates in county jail haven\\'t been convicted of anything. That\\'s more than 1,000 men and women. They are there not because they have been found guilty, but because they simply cannot afford bail.\"84 Short stays in jail not only entangle homeless people for longer periods of time due to their poverty, but also effectively un-house a number of people. Miles, a 51-year-old white man who camps, reported the impact of an arrest on his life: \"When I got arrested last time, that was when my marriage ended... They didn\\'t let me call work to explain (what happened). It took me two and a half, three days to explain to work why I was MIA.

Having spent the good month of January exploring a world of veganism, I\\'m pretty excited to try out some of the annual list\\'s new eats. It seems like there was some laziness going on since some dishes from previous years did somehow reappear back on the list (carnitas at Nopalito, banh mi from Saigon). Another gripe is that not just one, but two Charles Phan restaurants made it on the list this year. RickyBobby didn\\'t even show up this year! Although, I did notice that some of my favorite eats (cinnamon toast at Trouble Coffee) appeared on the list so now the somewhat hidden places will get even more popular.

       "    'text': 'Our demographic sample results fell in close range of the City\\'s own estimates based on annual point in time surveys. In 2013 San Francisco\\'s point-in-time survey included 952 respondents, and in 2011 1,024 respondents. Because the demographics of the city\\'s homeless fluctuate, and because these surveys, like our own, can never accurately represent the homeless population, we felt a range would be more appropriate than using the most recent count, which by now is two years out of date. Our own sample falls within the range of demographics found in the city survey in nearly every parameter. We made an additional effort to include transgender and gender non-conforming people, who are disproportionately likely to experience homelessness according to other national and local studies1 and whose experiences may be under-represented in the point-in-time count and other general surveys. In order to avoid under-counting gender non-conforming people, we provided respondents with a range of gender options and instructed them that they could choose all that apply.2 While some sub-groups of our sample are numerically small, it is crucial to analyze and present data from smaller sub-groups in order to discuss the particular ways these groups of respondents interact with the criminal justice system. !

       "    'text': 'The Civic Center Historic District has been officially documented on three separate occasions: the 1978 National Register of Historic Places nomination (1978 NR), the 1987 National Historic Landmark documentation (1987 NHL), and the 1994 San Francisco Landmark District (1994 SFLD).Each document provides a summary of the site history, a description of the district, information about the district\\'s significance, and evaluations of the resources within the district. While there is a lot of duplicative information, each also contains a unique perspective on the district and its resources. These documents also contain contradictory elements both within a single document and between the three documents. For example, the 1994 SFLD contains conflicting information about the 1236 Market Street building on block 0355 listing it under both the contributing-altered and non-contributing categories. The 1987 NHL provides descriptions of the district\\'s resources, but is vague in terms of establishing clear evaluations of whether some resources are contributing or non-contributing. Contradictions between the documents are more numerous. For example, the Powerhouse on block 0347 is contributing in the 1987 NHL, but non-contributing in the 1994 SFLD.This Cultural Landscape Inventory highlights these contradictions and others and provides clarification regarding the evaluation of extant features located in the district, which are outlined feature by feature in the Existing Conditions and Analysis section. To further clarify the similarities and differences between each of the documents, each document has been summarized below to provide an easy comparison of information relating to common information such as the district\\'s boundary, period of significance, evaluation criteria, areas of significance, architects/builders, resources that are deemed contributing, and statements of significance. A synthesis of the statements of significance from each of the documentation efforts is included in the appendix for reference. Summaries of the documents are listed below in reverse chronological order, with most recent first.1994 SAN FRANCISCO LANDMARK DISTRICT227Boundary: See Figure 1.2Period of Significance: 1906-1936Evaluation Criteria: Structures that have special character and special historical, architectural and aesthetic interest and value; constitutes a distinct section of the City.Areas of Significance: Beaux Arts styleArchitect/Builders (listed): Arthur Brown Jr., Bernard Cahill, Daniel H.

Additional information related to both of these potentially new areas of significance is included in the Statement of Significance Recommendation at the end of this section.CRITERIA RECOMMENDATIONThe Civic Center Historic District meets two of the four National Register/National Historic Landmark significance criteria:Criterion A/1: a property associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our historyCriterion C/4: a property that embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinctionThe first criterion, National Register Criteria A (National Historic Landmark Criteria 1), is documented in both the 1978 NR and the 1987 NHL. The second criterion, National Register Criteria C (National Historic Landmark Criteria 4), is documented in the 1978 NR, the 1987 NHL, and the 1994 SFLD. AREAS OF SIGNIFICANCE RECOMMENDATION The areas of significance that have been documented for the Civic Center Historic District today are: Architecture, Art, Beaux Arts, Community Planning and Development, Entertainment/Recreation (World\\'s Fair), Landscape Architecture, Politics/Government, and Social History. These areas of significance are listed in one or more of the three existing documents associated with the Civic Center Historic District. The Beaux Arts style relates primarily to the areas of Architecture, Art, Community Planning and Development and Landscape Architecture. Information about significance related to the mid-century modern era design of Civic Center Plaza, and the design of UN Plaza and Market Street BART, both of which are the focus of other studies, is included in the Statement of Significance Recommendation at the end of this section.1987 NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARK229 Boundary: See Figure 1.2Period of Significance: 1913-1951 with specific dates of 1912, 1915 and 1945Evaluation Criteria: NHL 1 (events) and 4 (works of art and architecture)Areas of Significance: Architecture, Art, Community Planning, Entertainment/Recreation (World\\'s Fair), Landscape Architecture, Politics/Government, Social History, Beaux ArtsArchitects/Builders (listed): Arthur Brown, Jr., Bernard J.S.

The 1994 NHL, which provided the best overview of the district\\'s significance, is a more concise and updated version of the 1978 NR and is the basis for the significance statement in the 1994 SFLD.

       "    'text': 'Introduction Transportation activities in San Francisco generate approximately 5.1 million tons of CO2 or 50% of total emissions. Reducing transportation sector emissions is a challenging task because sources are widely dispersed - transportation patterns are the end result of the numerous individual decisions people make about how to get from one place to another. In addition, actions to reduce transportation sector emissions often depend more on policies and programs on the national, state, and regional level than the local. For example, regional transit services such as Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Caltrain; and the high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes on the freeways operated by CalTrans exert considerable influence on transportation choices for those traveling into and out of the City. Federal and state decisions also influence fuel efficiency standards and funding for key transportation programs and infrastructure. Locally, several different departments and agencies have jurisdiction over transportation policies and services, including the San Francisco Transportation Authority, the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni), the Planning Department, the Department of Parking and Traffic, and the Department of Public Works. The City has existing policies in place to support reducing transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions, including those in the Transportation Element of the San Francisco General Plan and the Countywide Transportation Plan. In addition, the 1997 Citywide Bicycle Plan is being updated. Transportation Actions to Reduce Emissions One major approach to reducing transportation sector emissions is to reduce vehicle trips by encouraging a shift to alternative modes such as public transit, ridesharing, bicycling, and walking. Typically, mode shift is the result of multiple actions that cumulatively increase the attractiveness of alternatives to driving alone. Improving services, infrastructure, and providing incentives as well as creating disincentives for driving encourages citizens to consider alternate modes of transportation. Compared with other counties in the region, San Francisco has historically had the lowest rate of driving alone or carpooling, and the highest use of transit and bicycling/walking to commute to work. This is a result of the region\\'s unique geography, limited access points into and out of the city, an extensive transit service, and limited parking (only 48% of commuters who live in San Francisco have free parking compared to 78% region-wide).60 However, according to census data, the drive-alone rate increased from 60 Commute Profile 2002: A Survey of San Francisco Bay Area Commute Patterns. RIDES for Bay Area Commuters, Inc. October 2002. ! Table 3.1 Percentage of San Francisco Residents\\' Work Trips by Mode Means of Transportation to Work 1990 Census 2000 Census Drove Alone 38.5% 40.5% Carpooled 11.5% 10.8% Public Transportation (including taxicab) 33.5% 31.1% Bicycled or Walked 10.8% 11.3% Motorcycle or Other Means 1.9% 1.6% Worked at Home 3.8% 4.6% Source: Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP 2000). www.transportation.org/ctpp 1990 to 2000, while the rate of public transportation use and carpooling decreased (table 3.1). This indicates that more must be done to encourage the use of alternative modes. Another major approach to reducing transportation sector emissions is to modify the vehicles themselves - by improving fuel efficiency and switching to alternative fuel vehicles; as well as by downsizing fleets. The City has very progressive policies for its municipal fleet. However, community-wide changes in the types of vehicles used depend largely on federal and state action. Recommended transportation sector actions are grouped into six categories, listed in table 3.2. CO2 reduction has been estimated by category. Specific actions are described below. A. Increase the Use of Public Transit as an Alternative to Driving Estimated CO2 Reduction: 87,000 tons Public transit is an important alternative to driving. San Francisco has many natural incentives for transit use, including high density and limited parking, which have resulted in a very high transit use rate among residents. Census data for 2000 show a transit use rate of 31% in San Francisco, compared with a statewide and national average of only 5%61 and Bay Area average of approximately 10%.62 While the number of transit trips has increased over the past decade, transit\\'s share of total trips has decreased. According to Census data, transit use decreased from 35% in 1990 to 31% in 2000. Data from RIDES annual commuter survey show a similar trend.63 Climate Action Plan !

RIDES for Bay Area Commuters, Inc. October 2002. 63 Transit comprised 35% of total work trips among San Francisco residents in 1993 and 32% in 2002, with a peak of 41% in 1996. Public transit can attract more riders in a variety of ways - increased reliability, more frequent service, more routes, better safety and customer service, and lower fares. All of these factors are contingent on the amount of funding available for public transportation. More funding would allow transit operators to replace old vehicles, add vehicles to busy routes, add new routes, invest in capital improvements, and keep fares low. Land use patterns also affect transit use. Transit-oriented development (TOD) concentrates development around transit centers, reducing the need for vehicle trips and increasing the use of transit. Because San Francisco has already been built out, most opportunities to apply TOD strategies can only be applied to redevelopment of existing sites. Existing Actions San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni), a system of buses, electric trolleys, electric rail cars, historic streetcars, and cable cars provides extensive coverage of the city. Muni operates approximately 80 lines, with routes within one-quarter mile of nearly every location in San Francisco. Fares are affordable64 and service is reasonably reliable.65 Regional transit, serving passengers traveling into and out of the City includes various bus and rail operators-BART, Caltrain, Golden Gate Transit, Samtrans and AC Transit. Much of the local and regional service has been planned to coordinate multi-modal connections between Muni, BART, and Caltrain. Numerous ferries also provide service, connecting San Francisco with several cities around the Bay. The City\\'s Transit First Policy, passed in 1973 and incorporated into the City Charter, gives priority to public transit investments and provides street capacity and parking policies to discourage increases in automobile traffic. This policy has guided investment in transit priority improvements, such as designated transit lanes and streets and improved signalization, and increased transit service to meet the needs generated by new development. San Francisco\\'s Downtown Transportation Impact Fee (DTIF), implemented in 1981, has helped fund increases in transit services to meet peak demand generated by new offices in the downtown area. This $5 per square foot fee is assessed on new office construction and commercial office space renovation within a designated downtown district and is paid directly to the Municipal Transit District. In the first seven years, $82 million in fees were collected. Through its Better Neighborhoods Program, the City has been pursuing transit-oriented development, which includes using an extensive community involvement process to redevelop areas around BART 64 One-way base fares are currently $1.25, one of the lowest fares of any major transit system in the country. 65 Muni was plagued by on-time performance problems in the mid to late 1990\\'s, which negatively impacted ridership. Since then, service has improved considerably. The annual Muni Riders\\' Survey conducted by Rescue Muni shows a significant drop in the percentage of passengers delayed, from a high of 28% in 1998 to 14% in 2002 (Rescue Muni. Transfer. No. 17, July 2002). stations. The resulting improvements are designed to better integrate the stations into the surrounding neighborhoods and increase access to goods and services around the stations, increasing ridership and reducing the need for riders to make vehicle side trips for errands. Proposed Actions Expand Local Transit Service. Improve local service and attract more riders by increasing frequency and adding more routes. Increasing frequency, particularly on crowded routes and at peak times, was one of the top local transit improvements identified in the San Francisco Transportation Authority\\'s 1997 Citywide Mobility Study. Increase Funding for Major Local Service Improvements. Muni\\'s A Vision for Rapid Transit in San Francisco outlines several major long-term projects, including construction of new rail lines and bus rapid transit features such as dedicated busways and signal priority on heavily traveled corridors. These features would allow the system to accommodate higher volumes, reduce trip times, and increase passenger comfort and convenience, and thus attract more riders. Increased funding is needed in order to implement these projects. Expand and Improve Regional Service and Connections. Improve service and attract more riders on regional services such as BART, Caltrain, and ferries by extending service hours, increasing frequency, adding new routes, and keeping fares low. Improve inter-modal connections between local and regional service. Develop Regional Pass System. The Translink regional pass system, similar to pass systems in other major metropolitan areas, is currently in the pilot phase and scheduled to be implemented by BART and Muni within the next few years. By reducing the number of different passes and tickets required on transit systems in the Bay Area, Translink will facilitate intersystem transfers and encourage transit users. Speedy implementation of Translink on all Bay Area transit systems should be encouraged. Improve Safety, Customer Service and User-Friendliness of Muni. Improve local service and attract more riders with additional shelters and benches, better lighting at stops, and clearer street- level designation of routes and stops. Ensure that Muni maps are free and widely available for both residents and visitors. Improve customer service by training operators and attendants to be more courteous to passengers and provide better information, especially during service disruptions. Implement \"Smart Bus\" Technology. Recent technological innovations have coupled Global Positioning Systems (GPS) with electronic displays at transit stops to provide \"real time\" data to passengers. These tracking systems not only allow riders to know exactly when the next vehicle will be arriving, but also enables the system operator to track, schedule, and repair vehicles in service. Providing better information to passengers about scheduled arrivals can result in dramatic increases in passengers\\' perceptions of the service, even if the actual service provided is the same in terms of frequency and on-time arrivals. Similar systems implemented in Portland Oregon and other cities have resulted in increased ridership and lower operating costs. Muni has invested in this technology and steps should be taken to ensure that its primary purpose is to improve passenger information and customer service, rather than just operational tracking. Increase Marketing and Promotion of Public Transit. Increase awareness of public transit through advertising campaigns and internal promotion at work sites. Improve public access to transit information through promotion of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission\\'s (MTC) 511 toll-free phone and web service providing transportation information, and the Take Transit Trip Planner on the web. Expand Transportation Impact Fee Assessment. Apply the current transportation impact fee to all of the downtown commercial space that benefits from transit, and not just to new construction. Such a fee would provide more predictable and higher levels of revenue to San Francisco\\'s transit system. Create a Free Tourist Shuttle System. Create a free shuttle system, similar to those in other cities, with a fixed route and stops at a variety of popular tourist destinations. This would eliminate vehicle trips and parking spaces at popular destinations and provide an easy transportation alternative for tourists who are uncomfortable with a complex transit schedule. B. Increase the Use of Ridesharing as an Alternative to Single-Occupancy Driving Estimated CO2 Reduction: 42,000 tons Ridesharing provides another alternative to driving alone. In 2002, carpooling and vanpooling comprised 13% of San Francisco residents\\' commute trips and 18% of commute trips Bay Area-wide. Much ridesharing occurs spontaneously among family, friends, co-workers, and/or neighbors. Ridesharing is also facilitated by the ride-matching and referral services of RIDES for Bay Area Commuters, and by an informal system known as \"Casual Carpool.\" Existing Actions RIDES provides an easy-to-use, web-based ride-matching service for residents throughout the Bay Area that links drivers and riders, facilitating the formation of carpools and vanpools. RIDES also provides referral services for vanpool vehicle leasing. Many commuters from the East Bay find their ride through Casual Carpool, an informal system that developed more than 20 years ago so commuters could access HOV lanes on the highway and bypass the toll plaza on the Bay Bridge, saving both time and money. Drivers and riders congregate at one of the more than 19 designated pick-up locations for the morning commute and form carpools of at least 3 people per car, the minimum needed to zip though the toll plaza. Casual Carpool also exists for the return commute, although it is less popular. Ridesharing is facilitated by the presence of HOV lanes on several major regional highways and free bridge tolls during peak for carpools and vanpools, both of which reduce the time and cost of the commute, compared with driving alone. Preferential parking also provides an incentive. The City and County of San Francisco provides designated vanpool spaces at three different locations in the City and allows vanpools to park free at any city meter with a time limit of one-hour or more.66 The City also provides discounted parking for carpools at many of its City-owned garages located throughout the City, and employers can apply for preferential carpool spaces near their worksites.67 Proposed Actions Increase the Number of Miles of HOV Lanes. HOV lanes can significantly reduce commute times and are critical for increasing the attractiveness of ridesharing over driving alone.68 More HOV lanes would improve this incentive and send a strong message to drivers. Expand Carpool and Vanpool Designated Parking. Preferential parking for carpool and vanpool vehicles provides a strong incentive for ridesharing. Increase the use of the City\\'s existing programs and designation of additional carpool and vanpool spaces through outreach to large employers and coordination with the Department of Parking and Traffic. HOV Requirements in New Large Developments. To facilitate ridesharing as a viable and attractive option, the City can ensure that accommodations for ridesharing are included in any new large development or renovation. Requirements could include designating a certain percentage of parking spaces for high-occupancy vehicles, providing larger parking spaces to accommodate vans, and adequate passenger loading/unloading and waiting areas. Implement School Ridesharing Program. Introduce a formal program to assist parents in forming carpools to drop off and pick up kids at school. Increase Marketing and Promotion of Ridesharing. Increase the use of carpooling and vanpooling as an alternative to driving through additional outreach and education on the benefits of ridesharing and the services and incentives available. Climate Action Plan 66 Users must display a valid vanpool parking permit, available from the City\\'s Department of Parking and Traffic for $27 per year. 67 Carpools of three (3) persons or more can receive a 50% discount on the monthly parking rate in City-owned garages. Annual carpool permits are available for $27 per year. Spaces are first-come, first-served. 68 According to RIDES 2002 Commute Profile, approximately 29% of ridesharing commuters say they would not rideshare without HOV lanes. C. Increase Bicycling and Walking as an Alternative to Driving Estimated CO2 Reduction: 10,000 tons Shifting trips from driving to bicycling or walking reduces CO2 emissions. San Francisco has typically had relatively high rates of bicycling and walking due in large part to a high population density, mild weather, and limited parking, which discourages car ownership. According to Census data, San Francisco residents make approximately 11% of their work trips by bicycling or walking.69 Bicycling and walking could be increased through provision of better infrastructure, improved safety, and incentives. A 1997 survey of residents identified several priorities for bicycling and pedestrian improvements, including: more bicycle routes/lanes/paths; cleaner streets; better street and sidewalk maintenance; wider bike lanes; and more lighting.70 Existing Actions San Francisco does much to improve conditions for bicycling and walking. The City has added myriad new bike lanes, paths, and routes and currently has approximately 205 miles of designated bicycle network.71 The City has improved safety and access to walkways by repairing sidewalks and installing video cameras at traffic lights to record red light runners, and has worked closely with bicycling and pedestrian groups in the City on safety and access issues. Working with the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition, the City developed a bicycle safety brochure that includes maps of bike lanes, safe routes, and basic rules of the road. Bike to Work Day is a major annual event promoting bicycling for commuters. Bicycle passage is facilitated by rules allowing bicycles on several major transit providers, including BART, Caltrain, and some Muni buses. To improve parking, the City\\'s Department of Parking and Traffic annually installs an average of 300 new bike racks throughout the City. In addition, the City provides bicycle racks and/or lockers in several of the City-owned parking garages and is helping to promote bike stations to provide secure parking at major transit locations. Proposed Actions Continue to Increase the Number of Bicycle Lanes, Routes, and Paths. Lack of adequate infrastructure is a major barrier to bicyclists. Accelerate efforts to expand the current system and include mandatory bicycle lanes in future street improvements. 69 Figures were similar for both 1990 and 2000. 70 San Francisco Transportation Authority\\'s 1997 Citywide Mobility Study. 71 This includes 34 miles of streets with bicycle lanes, 88 miles with bicycle routes (signed), 54 miles with wide curb lanes (signed), and 29 miles of bicycle paths (2002 figures. Department of Parking and Traffic website: www.sfgov.org/site/dpt_index.asp. Continue to Improve Safe Access and Passage on Pedestrian Walkways. Increase sidewalk maintenance, widen sidewalks, add and improve crosswalks, increase the use of \"countdown\" crosswalk signals, and implement traffic calming actions in heavily used pedestrian areas. Improve Bicycle Access to Transit. Currently bicycles are only allowed on particular train cars and buses at particular times, limiting access to transit, particularly during peak hours. Transit agencies should expand the times and available space for bicycles on buses and trains. Continue to Improve and Expand Bicycle Parking Facilities. Augment existing parking with new bicycle racks, lockers, and bike stations through requirements on new developments, and/or grant programs for existing facilities. Increase Workplace Shower Facilities for Bicyclists. Facilitate bicycle commuting by requiring new developments to provide shower and changing facilities, and/or offer grant programs for existing buildings to add shower facilities for bicyclists. Increase Marketing and Promotion of Bicycling. Increase awareness and education about bicycling as a transportation option through expanded advertising and more events. D. Support Trip Reduction through Employer-Based Programs Estimated CO2 Reduction: 28,000 tons Employer-based strategies can be an effective way to reduce vehicle trips because a large percentage of trips are work-related and workers typically travel to the same place at about the same time every day, making it easier to find a practical substitute to driving. Employers are motivated to provide incentives for their workers as part of their overall benefits package to help attract and retain workers, and because Encouraging Bicycling in Municipal Operations City Hall Bicycle Room. This secure bicycle parking facility serves employees working in the Civic Center area, and offers showers and lockers for bicyclists. Fleet Replacement with Bicycles. The City has obtained several grants over the years to provide bicycles as replacements for vehicles on the job. Nearly 200 bicycles were provided for San Francisco Police Department officers and approximately 40 bicycles and 20 utility trailers were provided to gardeners in the Recreation and Parks Department. The Police Department now regularly purchases bicycles for its officers to use on the beat. Proposed: The City should continue these fleet replacement efforts with the Recreation and Parks Department and other appropriate departments. of the increased worker productivity achieved through reduced commute time and related stress. In terms of financial incentives, federal law allows employers to provide \"commuter tax benefits\" through which employees can deduct up to $100 per month, pre-tax, to use for transit and vanpool expenses saving employees up to 40% on their commute costs. Employers receive a savings on payroll taxes and they can further increase the incentive to workers by subsidizing the expenses. Another financial incentive is \"parking cash-out,\" through which employers provide a payment to employees who voluntarily forgo their parking space at a rate equivalent to the cost of the subsidized parking space. This type of program is appropriate when employers must lease parking spaces for their employees. Employer sponsored shuttles between transit stations and work sites can help to increase the attractiveness and viability of transit. Guaranteed ride home programs can provide the insurance of a free or low-cost ride home in cases of emergency. On-site facilities such as daycare centers and lunchrooms reduce the need to travel by car during the day to run errands. Access to company vehicles for meetings and errands also reduces the need for workers to commute by car when if they make trips from work during the day. Telecommuting and compressed work weeks (working longer hours but fewer days in a week) allow workers to eliminate work trips altogether.72 Another way to reduce the demand for trips is through teleconferencing or videoconferencing in place of in-person meetings that require travel. Existing Actions Employers throughout the City utilize the strategies described above to varying degrees. RIDES conducts outreach to employers to educate them about the strategies available and assist them with implementation. Many large employers and institutions in the City, such as hospitals and colleges, operate employee shuttles between BART stations and worksites. Commute Assistance Program for City & County Employees Commuter Tax Benefit Program. All City and County employees are eligible for pre-tax payroll deductions for transit and vanpool expenses. As of 2003, approximately 2,400 employees were enrolled. Hall of Justice Employee Shuttle. Transporting employees between the Civic Center station and the Hall of Justice during the morning and evening commutes, this shuttle provides nearly 20,000 passenger-trips a year. San Bruno Videoconferencing Project. Utilizing advanced technology, the City\\'s criminal justice staff can privately confer with clients in the San Francisco County Jail in San Bruno without making the 40-mile round trip drive. The program is eliminating an estimated 600,000 vehicle miles traveled per year. Compressed Work Week. Some departments allow employees to work a \"9-80\" schedule, receiving one day off every other week in exchange for working an extra hour every day. 72 A 1995 study for the California Air Resources Board showed that employees on compressed work weeks reduce their number of trips by 0.5 to 0.8 per week and their miles traveled by 13 to 20 per week as compared to employees on regular five-day work weeks (Philip Winters, Center for Urban Transportation Research). To eliminate the need for employees to drive to work in order to make midday trips, employers can join City CarShare, a local non-profit organization that provides a network of vehicles parked in neighborhoods throughout the City. Vehicles can be reserved on an as-needed basis and fees are paid by the hour and by the mile. City CarShare is open to residents as well as employers and their employees. The City encourages alternative commuting downtown through its requirement that employers in specifically designated commercial buildings73 provide on-site transportation management services, including a transportation management coordinator (TMC) to coordinate alternative commuting promotional activities and services, and conduct employee transportation surveys. The San Francisco Transportation Management Association (TMA) provides a networking forum and support services for all of the TMCs.74 Proposed Actions Expand Employer Commute Assistance and Outreach. Increase commute assistance and outreach for employers in San Francisco to educate them about the various trip-reduction strategies available (commuter tax benefits, parking cash-out, telecommuting, etc.), increase marketing of alternative modes to employees, and connect them with services available. Expand RIDES\\' outreach services or establish a new San Francisco-based outreach program. Implement Countywide Guaranteed Ride Home Program. San Francisco is currently one of the only counties in the Bay Area that does not offer a guaranteed ride home program. A relatively low- cost method of supporting alternative mode use, guaranteed ride home programs provide an \"insurance policy\" against being stranded in cases of illness, family crisis, rideshare vehicle breakdown, etc. Conduct General Marketing and Promotion of Commuter Services. By generating employee demand for programs and services, employers will be encouraged to provide more incentives for their employees to use alternative modes. Develop advertising and marketing campaigns to promote commuter tax benefits and other employer-based incentives and services. Expand Employer Transportation Management Requirements. Mandatory employer trip reduction programs yield significantly greater benefits than voluntary programs.75 The current requirements should be expanded to include other areas of the city and implementation of requirements for existing developments should be explored. 73 Includes all \"C-3\" designated commercial buildings with at least 100,000 square feet of office space in the downtown area, or at least 25,000 square feet in the South of Market area. 74 San Francisco Department of City Planning. Transportation Management Programs in Greater Downtown: Developer\\'s Manual for Procedures and Performance Criteria. January 1988. San Francisco Transportation Authority. Congestion Management Program. Nov. 2001. 75 An unpublished report prepared for the Transit Cooperative Research Program states that employers engaging in [transportation demand management] under a legal/regulatory mandate produced trip reductions that were three times as great as those performing voluntary efforts (24.5% vs.7%) (Eric N. Schreffler. \"What Makes for Successful TDM Programs?\"). E. Discourage Driving Estimated CO2 Reduction: 155,000 tons In addition to incentives and services designed to encourage the shift to alternative modes, strategies that create disincentives to single-occupancy driving and vehicle ownership can also be effective. This can be accomplished through restrictions, as well as setting price signals. For example, the cost and availability of parking can have a huge impact on driving behavior and vehicle purchasing decisions. Motor vehicle revenue such as gas taxes and registration fees cover only 10 to 40% of the costs incurred by local governments in providing the infrastructure, maintenance and services needed for automobiles.76 Setting price signals ensures that automobile drivers pay more of the full environmental and social costs of driving. While price signals can be a powerful mechanism to discourage driving and reduce vehicle miles traveled, they can also be very controversial and politically difficult to implement. In particular, pricing can be perceived as having a disproportionate impact on low-income individuals. It is imperative to have a good idea of demand before implementing pricing or restrictions. Existing Actions San Francisco already has a great deal of experience with some conventional strategies, including bridge tolls, parking fees, and residential parking permits. A 25% tax on parking fees collected by private garages and lots provides a significant source of revenue for the City\\'s public transit system. Residential parking permits limit the amount of available parking by controlling spillover parking from adjacent areas. City Carshare supports the choice to not own a car by providing alternative access to a vehicle when one is needed. Evaluations conducted for City CarShare indicate that people who do not own a car drive less and take alternative modes more often. Proposed Actions Increase the Gas Tax. Adjusted for inflation, gasoline prices in the U.S. were lower in 1998 than at any other time during the past fifty years. Even though fuel costs average only about 12% of the cost of owning and operating a car, drivers tend to consider gasoline prices to be the main indicator of their cost 76 Jose A.

To discourage driving, the City could implement congestion pricing on bridges or develop cordon tolls for entrance into designated areas of the City, such as downtown. These strategies have been successful in Norway and Singapore and were recently introduced in downtown London, England.78 Cap or Reduce the Number of Parking Spaces. Change requirements for new developments to lower parking minimums or switch to parking maximums. Reduce parking in areas well-served by transit. Restrict the number of parking permits issued to the number of on-street spaces and consider charging market rates. Some of these actions are currently being considered as part of the City\\'s Better Neighborhoods Program. Collect Parking Lot Taxes from Hotels. Because the City considers hotel guests \"temporary residents,\" it exempts them from parking lot taxes. By applying these taxes to hotel guests, the City would encourage visitors not to drive while in town, and generate additional revenue that could be used to fund transportation alternatives, such as increased Muni service or a free tourist shuttle. F. Increase the Use of Clean Air Vehicles and Improve Fleet Efficiency Estimated CO2 Reduction: 641,000 tons The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards set minimum levels of fuel efficiency for different categories of vehicles. Increasing CAFE standards would have perhaps the largest impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions of any single transportation action. While the City can advocate for a shift in these standards and create a demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles, increasing CAFE standards requires action on the federal level through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Aside from changing CAFE standards, fuel efficiency can be improved through fleet management policies. Purchasing the most fuel-efficient vehicle available in a given vehicle class can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Purchases can be geared toward what the vehicle will be used for on a regular basis rather than the exception, while still providing access to a range of different-sized vehicles. This ensures access to larger vehicles when needed while allowing an employees to use more fuel-efficient vehicles for the majority of trips. 77 In some states, local governments can raise gas taxes on their own. Oregon gives local governments the right to raise local gas taxes, subject to voter approval. Current local gas taxes range from $0.01 to $0.15 per gallon (compared to the federal tax of $0.183 per gallon and Oregon\\'s state tax of $0.24 per gallon.) However, these are relatively small tax increases that are not likely to do much to reduce vehicle travel. Studies show that increased gas taxes on the order of $0.25-0.50 per gallon would be necessary to substantially affect travel behavior. Obtaining changes in California state law and voter approval for a local gas tax surcharge on the order of $0.50 per gallon would be very difficult in most jurisdictions under present circumstances, and such a tax would not work for a single municipality in a larger urban area because of competition from municipalities without the tax. 78 Traffic levels fell by an estimated 25% on the first day of London\\'s congestion pricing scheme (BBC News. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2772583.stm. February 18, 2003.) Alternative Fuel Vehicles in Municipal Operations City Fleet Vehicles. As a result of Chapter 4, the Healthy Air and Smog Prevention Act, approximately one quarter of all City vehicle purchases over the past three fiscal years have been AFV\\'s. Currently, the City has almost 600 alternative fuel vehicles in its fleet, including 368 CNG, 97 electric, 55 bi-fuel, 52 hybrid, and 20 propane vehicles. Private Contractor Fleets. The City has also worked with its major service contractors to switch to AFVs, including an ambitious plan with its garbage/recycling collection contractor to convert to CNG and LNG heavy-duty vehicles. This includes the long haul transfer trucks that travel over 600 miles daily from the City\\'s transfer station to the landfill site, as well as curbside collection trucks. Public Transit Vehicles. The City\\'s public transit system has historically had a high percentage of AFV\\'s. Muni was originally an all-electric fleet. The current fleet is approximately 50% electric. Right Sizing and Down Sizing of the City Fleet. The City is in the process of implementing citywide carshare practices in its fleet operations. The City currently has two vehicle pools in operation that serve a number of City department staff. Many of the vehicles in the pools are AFVs. The City\\'s Green Fleets team continues to seek additional vehicle pool locations. Proposed: The City should continue implementation of Chapter 4, purchasing AFVs for the City fleet, as well as installing AFV fueling stations (especially those with public access), facilitating conversion of private sector fleets, right sizing and down sizing the City fleet, and creating carsharing vehicle pools. Muni should move forward with replacement of its old and highly polluting diesel buses with cleaner technologies. As mandated in Chapter 4, the City should also develop a plan to encourage the County\\'s residents to purchase AFVs and continue to support the efforts of the San Francisco Clean Cities Coalition to do likewise. The City should participate in demonstration projects to further advance the use of fuel cell technology and position itself to take advantage of future advances. Rapidly changing technology in the area of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) has produced a wide range of alternatives to conventional gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles. Replacing conventionally fueled vehicles with AFVs can yield significant emissions reductions.79 Currently viable alternative fuel technologies include compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), electric vehicles (EV), and hybrid-electric vehicles. Hydrogen vehicles - such as those that use fuel cells or that burn hydrogen in internal combustion engines - though not currently viable, are being developed by a variety of automakers. Development and implementation of AFV technology is driven largely by state requirements. California has been a leader in the nation, beginning with the California Air Resource Board\\'s adoption of the 1990 Low-Emission Vehicle (LEV) regulation requiring auto manufacturers to produce vehicles that meet increasingly stringent air quality standards. Of all vehicles sold in California by auto manufacturers, 2% were to be Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEV) by 1998 and 10% were to be ZEV by 2003.80 Existing Actions Although the City cannot directly affect CAFE standards, the Board of Supervisors passed a resolution supporting increased CAFE standards in the early 1990s. In 1999, the Board adopted the Healthy Air and Smog Prevention Act, which became Chapter 4 of the City\\'s Environment Code. This ordinance requires that all new purchases or leases of passenger vehicles and light duty trucks must either be rated as ultra- low emission vehicle (ULEV) or ZEV (at least 10% were to be ZEV by July 1, 2000). Requirements were also set forth for medium and heavy-duty vehicles and motorized equipment, and for phasing out all highly polluting vehicles and equipment.81 The City\\'s Green Fleets team coordinates procurement and purchasing of AFVs and processes departmental requests for exemptions. It also applies for specific federal, state and regional funds on a project-by-project basis and helps subsidize the conversion of private sector fleets. One of the barriers to purchasing AFVs is the lack of vehicles available on the market with the needed specifications, as manufacturers are often unwilling to produce certain types of vehicles unless they are certain that sufficient demand exists. The Green Fleets team works closely with manufacturers to facilitate 79 Emissions reductions achieved with natural gas vehicles depend on the vehicle type and engine efficiencies. Natural gas is a source of methane, which offsets some of the CO2 savings. Total greenhouse gas emissions savings for light duty natural gas vehicles are in the range of 7% to 20%. Without additional controls, heavy-duty natural gas vehicles may actually produce more greenhouse gas emissions than diesel vehicles. Emissions reductions achieved with electric vehicles depend on the source of electricity. All of these technologies are changing rapidly, and there are indications that greenhouse gas emissions savings with AFVs will increase in the future.

Pacific Northwest Pollution Prevention Resource Center website. http://www.pprc.org/pprc/pubs/topics/altfuels.html. 80 Auto industry lobbyists have succeeded in relaxing many of these requirements over time and the regulatory landscape is still in flux. 81 Exemptions are granted for public safety vehicles, public transportation fleet buses, or when the specific types of vehicles needed are not available, would be cost prohibitive, or fueling or maintenance infrastructure is not available. (City and County of San Francisco Environment Code, Chapter 4.). development of needed vehicles and stimulate the market for AFVs. Adequate fueling infrastructure is a key component to making AFV fleets viable and the City has contributed grant funds towards the development of three CNG fueling facilities. It continues to seek funds to expand this CNG fueling infrastructure and has also been successful in developing a number of electric vehicle charging stations both in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area. City CarShare provides a community-wide solution to vehicle fleets. By providing a network of vehicles in locations around the city, available for reservation on an as-needed basis, residents can utilize small, fuel-efficient and electric vehicles and reduce car ownership. City CarShare is also available for use by businesses and public entities. Proposed Actions Lobby for Increased CAFE Standards. The City should continue to advocate for higher CAFE standards by lobbying regional environmental agencies as well as its state and national representatives. Support LEV/ZEV Sales Mandates in California. Support efforts to maintain state requirements of automakers to produce or sell vehicles with no or very low emissions. Support State-Level Development of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards. Support state efforts to develop carbon pollution (greenhouse gas) standards for vehicles, such as Assembly Bill 1493.82 Implement Tiered Vehicle Registration Fees Based on Vehicle Size or Emissions. Discourage the purchase of high emission vehicles and encourage the purchase of low and zero emission vehicles by implementing a tiered vehicle registration fee system based on vehicle size or greenhouse gas emissions, as listed in the US EPA\\'s annual Green Vehicle Guide. Introduce Tiered Parking Rates Based on Vehicle Size. A tiered fee structure for residential parking permits and in parking garages based on vehicle size and/or emissions would encourage the purchase of smaller, more fuel-efficient (and less polluting) vehicles while discouraging larger and higher emission vehicles, such as Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs). Promote Bridge Toll and HOV Lane Waivers for AFV\\'s. Increase awareness of the existing program that allows AFVs with special stickers issued by the California Air Resources Board to use HOV lanes and cross for free on Caltrans-operated bridges.83 Expand the program to include the Golden Gate Bridge. 82 Assembly Bill 1493, authored by Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), requires the California Air Resources Board to develop carbon pollution (greenhouse gas) standards for vehicles in model year 2009 and beyond. The standards will apply to automakers\\' fleet averages, rather than each individual vehicle, and carmakers will be able to partially achieve the standards by reducing pollution from non-auto sources (e.g. factories, etc.). 83 Under CARB\\'s policy AFVs include battery electric vehicles and natural gas vehicles (including CNG, LNG and propane). Hybrids are excluded. Lobby Regional Agencies to Open Grants for Private Sector Uses. Current grant programs are restricted to public sector operations. However, tremendous potential exists to influence private sector use of AFVs and current limited efforts could be greatly expanded if grants were made available to private sector operations. Support Efforts to Expand City CarShare. Increase accessibility and availability with additional locations and vehicles, particularly fuel-efficient vehicles and AFVs. Promote and Enforce Bus Idling Traffic Code. The Department of Parking and Traffic (DPT) is responsible for enforcing the bus idling rule that the City passed in 1991. However, the rule is not well known and violations are often not reported to DPT. The City should disseminate information about this law to businesses that may have the most impact on bus idling violations, such as hotels, tourist destinations, and other places where buses are likely to stop and wait for passengers to load or unload.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Any analysis of populations affected by sea level rise must include a broader discussion of vulnerability to these events. According to the IPCC, vulnerability to climate change is the \"degree to which these systems are susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse impacts\" (Schneider et al. 2007). Vulnerability is a function of the magnitude of the impact, the sensitivity of the system to that impact, and the system\\'s ability to adapt. Vulnerabilities, like lack of access to a vehicle or other means of transportation, are shaped by \"intervening conditions\" that are not tied to a specific hazard but will greatly determine the human impact of the disaster and the specific needs for preparedness, response, and recovery (Hewitt 1997). Based upon a literature review of past flood disasters, we developed a set of key population characteristics that increase vulnerability to the adverse impacts of flood events and disasters (Figure 2). Vulnerability factors include access to preparedness information, transportation, healthcare, and insurance. Key demographics associated with these vulnerabilities include income, race, linguistic isolation, and residential tenure. Our analysis is largely centered on the distribution of race and income; a more comprehensive analysis of the human impact of sea level rise is needed for all vulnerable subgroups, including children, elderly, homeless, and incarcerated residents. Adaptation also raises environmental justice concerns. Adapting to sea level rise will require tremendous financial investment, and given the high cost, it is likely that we will not protect everything. Specifically, what we choose to protect and how we pay for it may have a disproportionate impact on low-income neighborhoods and communities of color. Decisions about how to use public funds can lead to inequitable distribution of costs and benefits, whether they are based on economics (protect the most valuable assets) or utility (protect the largest number of people). We urge, therefore, that policy makers planning responses to sea level rise understand and address environmental justice concerns carefully and proactively. 8 Figure 2. Relationship Between Socio-economic Factors and Vulnerability to Flooding Associated with Sea Level Rise Table 5 shows the number of people within the areas at risk of a 100-year flood that exhibit vulnerability to these events. Approximately 7,200 people currently at risk of a 100-year flood event live in a household with no vehicle. With projected rise in sea levels of 0.5 m, 1.0 m, and 1.4 m, the population within the areas at risk of flooding with no vehicle increases to 8,500, 9,800, and 10,700, respectively. These individuals will be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of sea level rise due to their increased chance of lacking the transportation means necessary to evacuate. In a survey after Hurricane Katrina, 55 percent of respondents who did not evacuate said one of the main reasons was that they did not have a car or other means of transportation (Brodie et al. 2006). Renters are also more vulnerable, as they are less likely to reinforce buildings and buy insurance because the decision to make major home improvements and financial gains typically lies with the property owner. Additionally, disaster recovery services have often targeted homeowners, to the disadvantage of renters and residents of public housing (Pastor et al. 2006). Of the population currently living within the 100-year floodplain, 52,100 (39 percent) live in renter-occupied housing. The renting population at risk increases to 59,400 with 0.5 m rise in sea levels; 67,300 residents with 1.0 m rise; and 72,100 with a 1.4 m rise. Language ability is an important factor in assessing vulnerability (Wang and Yasui 2008). Earthquake preparedness materials following the 1987 Whittier-Narrows earthquake in California, for example, were available only in English, despite other language needs of the victims (Tierney 1993, cited in Pastor et al. 2006). Additionally, emergency response crews may be unable to communicate with non-English speakers. A recent study of 148 emergency preparedness and public health entities found that only 72 percent provided links on their 9 website to translated materials, and only 14 percent offered courses for service providers that addressed potential language issues and cultural competence (Andrulis et al. 2008). Among the population at risk from a 100-year flood event with a 1.4 m sea level rise, 18,000 (7 percent) live in households along the San Francisco Bay that are \"linguistically isolated,\" meaning that no occupant over age 14 speaks English well (Table 11). This represents a 30 percent increase in the population that is currently at risk of a 100-year flood event. These households are the most likely to need preparedness materials and outreach strategies suitable for non-English speakers of various backgrounds. ! Table 5. Key Demographics of Populations Vulnerable to a 100-year Flood Event with Sea Level Rise Current Risk Risk with Sea Level Rise 0.5 m 1.0 m 1.4 m Population in linguistically isolated households 13,900 (10%) 15,600 (10%) 17,300 (8%) 18,300 (7%) Population in households with no vehicle 7,200 (5%) 8,500 (5%) 9,800 (4%) 10,700 (4%) Population in renter-occupied households 52,100 (39%) 59,400 (37%) 67,300 (31%) 72,100 (27%) Earn less than 200% of the federal poverty threshold 25,100 (19%) 28,400 (18%) 32,000 (15%) 33,900 (13%) People of color 66,600 (50%) 75,700 (47%) 85,700 (39%) 91,400 (34%) Note: Table shows the total number of people within the areas at risk that demonstrate key demographic vulnerabilities, and the percentage these individuals represent of the total population at risk. Race and income cut across many of the key vulnerabilities, with low-income and communities of color overly represented in the most vulnerable segments of the population. People of color are less likely to own their homes and less likely to speak English \"well\" or \"well at all\" (U.S. Census Bureau 2000). Additionally, the median household income of African American, Latino, and Native households in California was $15,000 less than white and Asian households (U.S. Census Bureau 2000). The correlation of lower income and race, and the over-representation of communities of color among those without legal residency and without health insurance, increases these communities\\' vulnerability to the harms of sea level rise even in the period following a disaster. The history of disparate treatment of people of color in recovery assistance services suggests another level of increased vulnerability. Along the San Francisco Bay, there are currently 66,600 African-American, Native American, Asian and Pacific Islander, and Latino residents living in areas at risk of a 100-year flood event. With a projected sea level rise of 0.5 m, 1.0 m and 1.4 m, this population at risk increases to 75,700, 85,700, and 91,400, respectively. 10',\n",

Black respondents reported the highest rate of past incarceration: 74% of Black respondents had been incarcerated, compared to 51% of white respondents. Forced displacement from public space disproportionately threatened the safety of gender non-conforming people who participated in this study: 59% of gender non-conforming participants felt less safe after they were forced to move. Women reported different safety risks related to displacement from public space, including vulnerability to sexual violence in an unfamiliar location. Those who identified as mentally disabled reported higher rates of being approached by the police (+10%) and higher rates of failure to address citations (+10%). survey participants were more likely to be cited, arrested and incarcerated than survey participants of any other racial group. The overwhelming majority of Black survey participants were approached by police (81%), searched (62%), forced to move (67%), cited (76%) and arrested and incarcerated (74%). Replication of this study would likely again demonstrate that across the board, 1) homeless respondents are much more likely to be arrested than people who are housed and 2) Black men and Black transgender women experienced the highest rates of arrest and incarceration. !

Of all the different categories of disadvantage reviewed in this section, race was most closely tied to frequency of law enforcement interactions, especially incarceration. These findings on the frequency of experiences with law enforcement are also matched by the perceptions of those on the street. As Joseph, a 68-year-old Black man interviewed for the study explained, \"Asians, Blacks, Latinos and Chicanos-I feel [police] target them the most... I want to think it\\'s something like a written thing, that if you are any of the people I just named, then you are doing something wrong for that matter. They automatically come up with that mindset, thinking \\'You can\\'t be doing any-thing right, you got to be doing something wrong. There\\'s too many of you together, so there\\'s got to be something going on that\\'s not right.\" A national survey by the Western Regional Advocacy Project (WRAP) found that homeless people widely perceived their race, gender and disabilities as factors in being given citations; 77% reported that they believed they were ticketed because of their economic status, but 35% reported it was also or solely because of their race, 24% their gender, and 24% their disability.112 Mass incarceration not only deepens poverty, it also perpetuates racial inequality: Nationwide, 11% of 25-29 year-old Black men are incarcerated on any given day,113 and one-third of black men in their twenties are under correctional supervision.114 Black men are over six times more likely to be incarcerated than white men, and Latino men are 2.5 times more likely to be incarcerated than white men.115 San Francisco is no exception to the national trend of mass incarceration of poor people of color: 56% of people incarcerated in the San Francisco jails are Black, and 84% of people in San Francisco jails have not been convicted of any crime-they are in jail simply because they are unable to afford bail.116 112 Western Regional Advocacy Project, supra note 39. 113 PEW Center on the States, supra note 74. 114 Michael Tonry and Matthew Melewski, \"The Malign Effects of Drug and Crime Control Policies on Black Americans.\" Crime and Justice 31: 1 (2008). 1-44. 115 Analysis of Bureau of Justice Statistics Data by The Sentencing Project, \"Trends in U.S. Corrections\" (2013); E.

The most dramatic disparities in rates of arrest and incarceration in our sample are between Black and white survey participants: 77% of Black men (N=97) and 57% of white men (N=78) who participated in our survey had been arrested and incarcerated at some point in their lives. The discriminatory incarceration of Black San Franciscans goes unquestioned by many city officials: The city controller\\'s office uncritically states that the San Francisco jail population will increase in direct proportion to increase in the number of African Americans in San Francisco. The disproportionate incarceration of Black people in San Francisco is so taken-for-granted that the Controller\\'s Office assumes a reciprocal relationship between San Francisco\\'s Black population and the City\\'s jail population: \"The African American population in San Francisco decreased by 18 percent (59,461 to 48,870) between 2000 and 2010, and the DOF projects a continued decline through 2050 to 34,101. These population changes are relevant because, as mentioned previously, adults age 18 to 35 and African Americans are disproportionately represented in the jail population. A decline in these populations could have a downward impact on the jail population into the future.\"117 This statement acknowledges San Francisco\\'s policy of massive incarceration of Black San Franciscans-and then normalizes it. Rather than questioning racist policies that result in the hugely disproportionate number of Black people behind bars in San Francisco, city officials take for granted that a large proportion of the city\\'s Black residents have always 117 Id.

Officials assume that Black San Franciscans will either be locked up or priced out of the city. It is likely that such assumptions-by police officers as well as court personnel and elected officials-both demonstrate and result in anti-Black discrimination. This bias helps to explain the extremely high numbers of Black homeless respondents to our survey who have been arrested and incarcerated.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Not only does the policy of displacement fail to accomplish its intended goals of decreasing the so-called \"uncivil activities,\" such as resting in public places, it also exacerbates the health and safety risks faced by homeless individuals. Our survey found that 31% of participants felt less safe in their new location, while only 9% felt safer. Gender non-conforming participants who were forced to move often felt unsafe in a new location: 59% of gender non-conforming participants felt less safe when they were forced to move. Safety risks for those who moved elsewhere were often considerable. One of our 43 interview participants told us that she was raped while sleeping outdoors, after police forced her to move away from a location where she felt safer. Many respondents were forced to move while trying to rest or sleep. Sleeplessness has been linked to adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including impaired cognitive function, heart disease, diabetes and depression. Sleep deprivation is especially problematic for a population that already has a higher-than-average likelihood of experiencing mental illness.41',\n",

       "    'text': 'In a city with dozens of attractions, you may have trouble deciding where to spend your time. Here are the highlights for this destination, as chosen by AAA editors. GEMs are \"Great Experiences for Members.\" San Francisco sits on a peninsula, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the east by San Francisco Bay. At the northern tip is the AAA GEM attraction Golden Gate Bridge, the landmark by which all travelers orient themselves to the city. Golden Gate National Recreation Area, one of the largest urban national parks in the world, encompasses 59 miles of bay and ocean shoreline on both ends of the span. Noted for its dazzling scenery, the park preserves some 1,250 historical and cultural sites, including Alcatraz Island and Muir Woods. On any sunny afternoon, Golden Gate Park is one of the most popular places in San Francisco. This AAA GEM attraction has it all: botanical gardens, museums, sports fields, playgrounds-even a buffalo enclosure and a fishing pond. Three miles south of its namesake bridge, the city park covers more than a thousand acres between Stanyan Street and Ocean Beach. A Dutch windmill stands at the western entrance; the white dome of the Conservatory of Flowers dominates the eastern end. This Victorian greenhouse shelters a humid jungle of giant ferns and delicate orchids. The entire park is an oasis of exotic greenery. Fantastic, otherworldly plants from Chile, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa make the 55-acre San Francisco Botanical Garden at Strybing Arboretum an unforgettable walk. Free guided tours are given every day. The Japanese Tea Garden, developed for the 1894 World\\'s Fair, is especially lovely during cherry blossom season in the spring.

On rainy days, Golden Gate Park offers a cluster of museums around Stow Lake (one of a dozen man-made ponds designed by Scottish landscaper John McLaren). The burnished copper facade of the de Young Museum draws visitors to one of the country\\'s finest collections of American paintings. Founded in 1895, the museum underwent a massive expansion in 2005. Another of the park\\'s highlights, The California Academy of Sciences, was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and later torn down to make way for a $500 million structure designed by architect Renzo Piano. The new facility, which rose from the ashes of the old, is in the forefront of the concept of sustainable architecture with its recycled steel construction and green roof. This AAA GEM attraction retains such old favorites as the Steinhart Aquarium and the Morrison Planetarium while adding a host of new exhibits. North of the park on a hill overlooking the Pacific and the Golden Gate, the Legion of Honor is one of the city\\'s greatest treasures. The Beaux Arts building, modeled after the 18th-century Palais de la Legion d\\'Honneur, was built to honor Californians who died in France during World War I. The ocean view from here is particularly breathtaking. This AAA GEM is home to Rodin\\'s famous statue, the \"Thinker,\" along with some 84,000 other sculptures, paintings, prints, decorative arts and antiquities. A spectacular collection of Asian art spanning 6,000 years is housed at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, another AAA GEM attraction. Here are exquisite Persian ceramics, Cambodian deities, Indian temple reliefs, Thai daggers, Japanese textiles, Tibetan scrolls and one of the oldest Chinese Buddhas in the world. The maplewood galleries of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art read like a \"Who\\'s who\" of 20th-century art: Picasso, Matisse, O\\'Keeffe, Pollock, Magritte, de Kooning, Lichtenstein, Rothko, Warhol. The brick-and-steel building with its striated skylight is an artistic achievement in Attractions Map Get maps and turn-by-turn directions using TripTik Travel Planner on AAA.com Attractions Details - Get additional information on AAA.com; - GEM Attraction offers a Great Experience for Members 16.

Muir Woods National Monument 20. Point Reyes National Seashore itself. In contrast to this modernistic landmark, the Palace of Fine Arts resembles a Roman ruin. The classical rotunda, built as the entrance to the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition, was meant to last only a year. San Franciscans loved it so much, they made it permanent. Lagoons surround the palatial hall, which is home to Exploratorium, the museum of \"science, art and human perception.\" At this AAA GEM attraction, visitors of all ages will have fun touching, trying and testing their skills at 650 hands-on exhibits. Another of the city\\'s most revered antiquities is the Mission San Francisco de Asis, one of the oldest buildings on the peninsula. Still visible are the rawhide lashings that Spanish missionaries used in the 18th century to secure its redwood timbers. This AAA GEM attraction, also known as Mission Dolores, withstood the 1906 earthquake while latter additions fell. The adjacent church, an elaborate mixture of Moorish and Corinthian styles, is a striking counterpoint to the simple mission. Sooner or later, all tourists make the pilgrimage to Fisherman\\'s Wharf. The northern waterfront bustles with shoppers, sightseers, crab trappers and T-shirt vendors. To add to the noise and fun, Pier 39 is the winter home for hundreds of rowdy sea lions. Here too are museums, the historic Cannery, an aquarium and a fleet of tall ships at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. Be sure to sample the Ghirardelli chocolate, sourdough bread and catches of the day. Ferries from the Alcatraz Cruises fleet depart from Pier 33 for Alcatraz Island, the old federal prison that sits on a forbidding rock in the middle of the bay. Thirty-six prisoners tried to escape between 1934 and 1963, but none made it to freedom, and many died in the attempt. A group of American Indians claimed the island in 1969 and occupied it for 2 years. National park rangers lead guided tours, or you can explore \"The Rock\" on your own. Tours sell out quickly in the summer; call ahead for reservations. If you\\'ve taken advantage of San Francisco\\'s public transit, the Cable Car Museum and Powerhouse Viewing Gallery is worth a stop. Displays at the Washington-Mason Powerhouse include the first cable car, built in 1873. In an underground gallery, you can see the channels and pulleys that guide the cars beneath the street. The San Francisco system is one of only two National Historic Landmarks that move; the other is New Orleans\\' St. Charles streetcar line. Any time left to explore beyond the city limits? Take a scenic drive north toward Mill Valley on SR 1. Here on the slopes of Mount Tamalpais is Muir Woods National Monument and one of the region\\'s last old-growth stands of coastal redwoods. These ancient sequoias can reach 250 feet high and 15 feet across, and some have stood for a millennium. A paved, 1-mile walking trail leads from the visitor center to the aptly-named Cathedral Grove. Traffic heading to this AAA GEM attraction can be heavy on weekends; plan to arrive early. If you keep going north on SR 1, you\\'ll reach the crashing breakers, grassy dunes and mossy forests of spectacular Point Reyes National Seashore.',\n",

       "    'text': ' Twenty-two of the survey cities described their responses to veterans\\' homelessness, some briefly, others in detail. Most described ways in which they have taken advantage of targeted federal programs such as HUD-VASH and SSVF and integrated them into overall efforts to combat chronic homelessness in their cities. Many have engaged in the national multi-agency initiative, promoted through Rapid Results Housing Boot Camps, to house 100 chronically homeless persons, including veterans, in 100-day periods. Washington, Charlotte, and Cleveland report having taken advantage of these programs. x In Asheville, the HUD-VASH coordinator and case managers partner with local faith communities to support homeless veterans\\' move into housing. These faith communities collect furniture and household goods for the veterans\\' new homes; goals are to provide a warm welcome to the veterans, ease their transition into permanent housing, and lighten the burden of the many details that go along with setting up a new household. x In Providence, Operation Stand Down Rhode Island follows the \"Housing First\" model, providing over 40 units of permanent housing combined with a full range of services to ensure that veterans will be able to remain in their apartments. Supportive services include, but are not limited to: intensive case management, coordination of mental health and substance abuse treatment, assistance with VA benefits and employment, training, and job placement services. x In Santa Barbara, service providers have been successful in combining Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program and, more recently, SSVF funding for homeless prevention, and Rapid Re-Housing funding for veterans and veteran families. Collaboration between local agencies and the VA clinic has provided multiple access points for veterans seeking resources related to homelessness. The balance of the cities provided the following descriptions of their efforts: Boston: At the New England Center for Homeless Veterans, the Veterans Training School offers comprehensive employment assessment for veterans who are homeless, unemployed, or underemployed by providing them with intensive and individualized assessment and the tools they need to move toward self-sufficiency. The school provides: pre-vocational courses in business and computers; vocational courses in commercial driver\\'s license, security officer training, and culinary arts; life skills courses in money management; and self-esteem classes. An Information Resource Center provides: a computer lab with Internet access, a resource library, one-on-one computer instruction, job search assistance, online application assistance, assistance in obtaining online e-mail accounts, resume writing, and JumpStart Workshops. Charleston: Crisis Ministries recently received a $2 million grant from the VA for Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) and has opened a new facility, Veterans Housing Services, dedicated to providing the needed services in a central location. The goal of the program is to promote housing stability among very-low-income veteran families who reside in, or are transitioning to, permanent housing through a wide range of supportive services. Many of these veterans\\' families are homeless. Services include: case management, employment and education, fiduciary and rep payee services, legal services and income support, housing counseling, and financial assistance. The intended outcomes of SSVF are to reduce time spent in a shelter or in at-risk housing situations, and successful housing retention and stability. Chicago: A team of City of Chicago and Chicago Housing Authority staff and nonprofit leaders recently capped off a 100-day collaborative effort to assist chronically homeless people in Chicago, resulting in over 400 individuals and families moving from the streets and into housing. Within this group were 243 veterans who were housed between June 1 and August 31. Many received rental assistance through the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center and Chicago Housing Authority\\'s federal Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) grant partnership. The achievements are the direct result of the hands-on efforts of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the City of Chicago, and over 50 private, non-profit supportive housing agencies that provided housing or conducted street and shelter outreach. Since joining the national 100,000 Homes Campaign in August 2010, Chicago has continued to identify and engage the most vulnerable and chronically homeless individuals and families, finding them a home in permanent supportive housing. The group seeks to maintain the momentum of housing placements going forward through sustained 100-day action plans. Dallas: A collaborative effort of the Continuum of Care, Dallas Housing Authority, CitySquare, and the Veterans Affairs Department has created an awareness of veterans\\' homelessness and the need for action. The Collaborative has been successful in the four months since it came together. One hundred thirty veterans were successfully housed and the Collaborative will continue to serve this demographic as long as necessary. Of the veterans housed, 70 percent were classified as chronically homeless. Those housed included single men and women as well as women veterans and their children. Among Veterans Affairs Department programs supported by the community to help veterans experiencing homelessness or at-risk of homelessness are: a compensated work therapy program that provides vocational rehabilitation and a program of supported employment; a supported employment program that recruits employers and businesses to offer employment opportunities to veterans while providing coaching and ongoing support to the veteran to help maintain employment; and an annual event, hosted by the Veterans Affairs Department with support from social service providers, that enable veterans to access the service providers\\' treatment programs, clothing assistance, HIV testing, flu shots, haircuts, and other needed services. Currently, the Metro Dallas Homeless Alliance is in partnership with the HUD-VASH program to house an additional 75 veterans by the end of the year. This effort is a result of the 100 Homes 100 Vets program that was successful during 2013. Denver: Denver\\'s Road Home, the City and County of Denver\\'s Ten Year Plan to End Homelessness, is collaborating with housing providers, non-profits, the Denver VA Hospital, and landlords in a new project from the 100,000 Homes Campaign. A team from Denver attended a Rapid Results Acceleration Boot Camp this summer to learn how to improve service delivery systems around vulnerable people. The goal of the Boot Camp is for the attendees to return to their community and create a housing placement engine of change that will align with the federal strategic goals of ending chronic and veteran homelessness. The team established an initial 100-day planning period to get in place additional partners and establish the 100-Day Campaign goals. The Campaign, begun on November 4, aims to house at least 87 chronically homeless individuals per month; 27 percent of these will be veterans. The overall campaign goal is to end 40 chronic homelessness and veteran homelessness in Denver by January 2016. This campaign will build on the City\\'s successful 2012 Campaign, \"100 Vets in 100 Days.\" Last year, 80 chronically homeless veterans were housed in 100 days and the number of days from referral to lease up was reduced by 43 percent. Los Angeles: The Los Angeles Continuum of Care (CoC) implemented the Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) Workgroup to build upon the collaboration initiated between the CoC providers, Public Housing Authorities, and the Veterans Administration during the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid ReHousing (HPRP) program. This workgroup consists of veteran-specific providers and CoC point-of-entry providers including access centers, drop-in centers, street outreach teams, representatives of the VASH program from the Greater Los Angeles VA Healthcare Center, and Los Angeles County Departments providing public services. The goal is to ensure that homeless veterans are immediately identified when requesting homeless services in order to determine the appropriate interventions to meet their needs and connect them to the comprehensive array of medical, social services, and VASH vouchers available through the Veterans Administration. These efforts are consistent with the CoC\\'s plan for the integration of all community resources in enhancing service delivery systems for specific populations of homeless persons, such as veterans. The CoC will continue to strive to improve these types of collaborations in the future, to ensure that veterans are provided with the appropriate interventions specific to their needs in order for them to be rapidly rehoused as quickly as possible. Louisville: The Homeless Veterans Outreach Program, considered the most important program addressing homeless veterans\\' needs in Louisville, has four staff members who perform regular homeless outreach for veterans at the day and evening emergency shelters. They also work with the 100,000 Homes project to maintain an agreed-upon list of all homeless veterans in the community - a list used in a collective effort to place veterans in housing and connect them to needed services. The national Volunteers for America organization also operates a program in Louisville which identifies and assists veterans with families in accessing services and housing. Memphis: Alpha Omega Veterans Services provides a range of housing options for veterans experiencing homelessness. The organization, which focuses on peer-based strategies, has a strong sense of community in its permanent housing programs and has shown strong performance in assisting veterans to obtain employment. Most of the staff members are former program participants. Nashville: The $3 million in Supportive Services for Veteran Families funds provided to Davidson and surrounding Middle-Tennessee Counties are key to moving veterans and their families from the streets into permanent housing. Centerstone, the national behavioral healthcare organization, provides outreach, case management, and benefit achievement assistance to eligible veterans and family members. Of the 390 families served, 90 percent achieve stable housing before program completion. Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc. (OSDN), the most recent local recipient of SSVF assistance, is the primary nonprofit resource for veterans in Middle Tennessee, providing social services including employment readiness, placement assistance, transitional housing, and coordination of other agencies\\' services. Assistance provided to honorably discharged veterans includes: obtaining personal IDs; filing for VA, Social Security and Food Stamp benefits; obtaining military records; employment assistance; housing assistance; Microsoft applications training; obtaining VA medical treatment eligibility; clothing; personal care items; and much more. OSDN, where \"Every day is Veterans Day,\" anticipates assisting over 2,000 veterans and their families during 2013. Norfolk: The Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority, in conjunction with the Hampton VA Medical Center, Norfolk Office to End Homelessness, local homeless service providers, the national 100,000 Homes initiative, and the Rapid Results Institute, has committed to housing the nation\\'s heroes as part of the national effort to end chronic homelessness among veterans by 2015. Utilizing the HUD VASH voucher and other permanent supportive housing programs, and through coordinated ongoing case management, Team Norfolk has set the ambitious goal of housing 115 veterans locally over 100 days - an average of 35 veterans per month from September through November. Norfolk was selected by HUD to participate as one of 20 cities in this national campaign. In early August, Donnell Brown, Kimberly Thomas and Pamela Jones-Watford attended the VASH Boot Camp in Philadelphia where they trained with national leaders committed to making the veterans\\' housing dream a reality in Norfolk. Philadelphia: The Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) have been collaborating since 2008 in the implementation of the HUD and VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program, which provides a chronically homeless veteran with a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) along with services from HUD-VASH case managers. 100,000 Homes held one of its Rapid Results Veterans Boot Camps in Philadelphia in early August to ramp up efforts to assist veterans experiencing homelessness. In Philadelphia, before the Boot Camp, after a veteran completed the voucher briefing and received his/her voucher, the 120-day clock for the veteran to identify a unit would start ticking. Once a unit was identified, the veteran would have to submit paperwork in order for PHA to complete an inspection to ensure the unit met Housing Quality Standards. If it did not, one or more re-inspections would be needed. The logistics involved in completing all the steps required were time consuming - and the clock would continue ticking, with the increasing likelihood a veteran would not be successful in the program. During the Boot Camp, as VA and PHA staff mapped out the process and the number of steps and amount of time involved, it became clear that something needed to change. The solution came from a PHA staff member: Pre-inspected units. With this, the concept of \"See and Move In Tours\" was born and is now a standard operating procedure for PHA. Now, immediately following the voucher briefing, a veteran and case manager visit units that have already passed inspection. On the first trial, PHA inspected 10 units, with eight of them passing. Five veterans with new vouchers visited the units and all signed leases immediately. Officials report that with a little innovation, amazing communication, and some determination, a process that was averaging over 90 days to complete now can take as little as two days. Phoenix: Phoenix has a unique initiative, H3 Vets (H3 = home, health, hope), a collaborative aimed at ending chronic homelessness among veterans. In addition, Phoenix participated in the Rapid Results Institute sponsored by Community Solutions (100,000 Homes) to enhance H3 Vets, and to build an additional local team to end overall homelessness. The community has responded with service and housing commitments, and a comprehensive systems re-engineering which quickly identifies chronically homeless vets and connects them with housing and services. Since the launch of H3 Vets, the population of chronically homeless vets has declined by over 65 percent. Indeed, Phoenix is poised to get to functional zero, perhaps by the end of the year, with only 54 chronically homeless veterans remaining to be housed. Saint Paul: The Minnesota Assistance Council for Veterans (MACV) provides homeless or near-homeless veterans and their families with homelessness prevention and re-housing assistance. MACV attempts to forestall imminent homelessness for families impacted by a one-time, non-repetitive - but nonetheless consequential - event such as an illness, unemployment, or an accident. Services include rental/mortgage assistance, security/damage deposits, utility assistance and, as appropriate, transportation assistance while the veteran is being stabilized. To be eligible for assistance, a client must be a veteran with an honorable discharge and 181 days of active duty service. The veteran must be a Minnesota resident (for a minimum 30 days) and homeless or at imminent risk of becoming homeless, and must be motivated to make positive change. Generally, assistance is provided on a one-time basis and the payment made is considered sufficient to resolve the crisis. Paramount in MACV\\'s service delivery is outreach - to food shelves, shelters, community centers and clinics providing services to individuals and families-including regular outreach and collaboration with the Union Gospel Mission, Dorothy Day Center, and Salvation Army in Saint Paul. As a direct result of its community education and outreach, MACV connects with more veterans than ever before, and many veterans are referred to MACV\\'s housing program by service organizations operating in the communities surrounding MACV\\'s regional offices. Project activities are ongoing. Currently, an estimated 42,870 veterans live in Ramsey County. Of these, approximately 420, including nearly 120 families, will experience an episode of homelessness sometime during the year. In 2012, MACV provided intensive case management and direct services to 74 veterans and families in Ramsey County - the majority of them from Saint Paul. The average cost to prevent homelessness is $500-700 for each veteran served. Re-housing services can be much higher, depending on the individual veteran\\'s situation. MACV\\'s multi-faceted, comprehensive approach focuses on the unique needs of homeless veterans, veterans in crisis, and their families. These veterans also can access MACV\\'s additional programs and services (funded by other sources) to aid in achieving long-term stability. These services include life skills and job training, employment assistance, transitional and permanent supportive housing, and civil legal assistance. MACV offers a supportive, drug-free environment in which services help veterans reach full recovery. Programming and services provide for basic needs - including housing/shelter, health care, food and clothing - and provide \"next steps\" to assist them in developing the skills necessary to secure employment and create and sustain economic independence. In 2009-2012, the City\\'s Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program allocated funds to MACV for both prevention and re-housing services. During 2010-2011, the City, MACV, and the Ramsey County Housing and Redevelopment Authority also worked together to create supportive housing for six homeless veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. HRA used NSP-1 funds for property acquisition, and MACV provides ongoing support services. During 2012, MACV opened a second house to provide supportive housing for women veterans. Finally, during 2009-2013, the City has allocated some ESG funds to MACV for homelessness prevention services, and MACV continues to be a strong partner with the City/County\\'s Heading Home Ramsey Program San Antonio: The American GI Forum National Veterans Outreach Program (NVOP) continues to promote its housing initiative by expanding the opportunities for veterans in the area of affordable housing. With support from the Home Depot Foundation, the National Community Stabilization Trust, and Bank of America, NVOP has already started rehabilitation of homes for those veteran households pursuing affordable home ownership through the Veterans Homeownership Program (VHP). In addition, NVOP has been instrumental in strengthening community efforts in support of the program. Recently, NVOP fostered a partnership with USAA, one of the oldest military financial institutions in the country, to establish financing and homebuyer guidance for those veterans interested in homeownership. NVOP was also able to increase community involvement by developing collaborations with other non-profits, such as 43 Avenida Guadalupe and the Financial Empowerment Center, to educate the veteran population on the requirements and steps necessary to repair credit and develop personal budgeting plans. With the initial selection made for the first phase of veteran homes, NVOP is in the process of assisting with resources and guidance regarding the homebuyer process and has provided case management services to those clients needing additional attention to address the blemishes on their credit reports. NVOP also has been pleased by the response to the VHP. As a result of intensive outreach efforts, contacts by interested veterans have doubled since the program\\'s inception. Also, NVOP has recently been granted an expansion of areas in which homes are available through the program. Homes are projected to become available in Austin, San Marcos, New Braunfels, Corpus Christi, the Eagle Ford Shale area, and El Paso. In response to the demand of clients for affordable housing, NVOP intends to see the VHP continue to expand and eventually offer other permanent housing opportunities, such as multi-family units. San Francisco: Given the high cost of housing in the San Francisco community, and the very difficult challenge homeless veterans face in trying to secure their own housing, project-based solutions have been especially effective in connecting homeless veterans to the housing and services they need, and stabilizing them on the long term. One building, Veterans Commons, has been financed with a variety of local and federal resources, and has been exemplary. It permanently houses 75 chronically homeless and disabled veterans in a supportive environment with comprehensive on-site services, including case management, mental health, and medical care. The building, which opened in November 2012, was a historic site owned by the City and for years had been used as a storage facility. The project took six years and cost approximately $30 million. One resident described the building\\'s residents saying: \"A lot of us don\\'t have the best social skills when it comes to doing normal things. Now we get all this help. It blows my mind.\" \"We are the type of people who don\\'t ask for help,\" he says. \"Veteran Commons has done a lot for me. I can\\'t praise them enough.\" The project has had exceptionally high stability rate of veterans so far. As a result of their monthly meetings, the San Francisco Homes for Heroes Team, a collaboration of local community based organizations, federal agency staff from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and local human services, housing authority and public health staff are exploring methods for increasing the number of project based housing units for the most vulnerable homeless veterans in the community.',\n",

       "    'text': \" The survey cities reported a 7 percent average increase in the pounds of food distributed. More than three in four (77 percent) of the cities saw an increase, 14 percent saw a decrease, and 9 percent said it remained the same. Collectively, in the survey cities, 557 million pounds of food were distributed over the past year. Fifty-seven percent (12) of the cities reported that their total budget for emergency food purchases increased over the past year, 14 percent (three cities) said it remained the same, and 29 percent (six cities) said it decreased. Across the responding cities, the budget for emergency food purchases increased by less than 1 percent. Collectively, in the survey cities, the year's total emergency food budget was $325 million. Donations from grocery chains and other food suppliers accounted for nearly half (49 percent) of the food distributed. This source was followed by federal emergency food assistance, which accounted for 19 percent, and purchased food, which accounted for 19 percent. Donations from individuals accounted for 9 percent and those from other sources accounted for 6 percent. Over half (52 percent) of the cities reported that they had made at least some significant changes in the type of food purchased. These changes generally involved the purchase of fresher, healthier, more nutritious foods, particularly fresh produce and foods high in protein and low in fat, sodium, and sugar. Trenton officials report, however, that, due to limited funding, they were unable to purchase an adequate amount of fruits and vegetables, whole grain products, or protein items. Among the changes cities have made: In Asheville, there has been a concerted effort to solicit more donations from local and regional farmers in order to increase fresh produce. In Boston, there has been a continued increase in variety as well as the amount of fresh produce. In Chicago, there has been a concerted effort to increase the amount of fresh food distributed in addition to the traditional non-perishable food items distributed to those in need of emergency food assistance. The Chicago Department of Family and Support Services recently implemented the Emergency Food Pantry Program, which offers a greater assortment of food products, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, beef, dairy products, and a variety of other perishable and non-perishable food items. In Cleveland, distributing food with a high nutritional value has become a top priority of the Foodbank, which has focused on acquiring fresh produce and which has distributed nearly 12.5 million pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables during the last fiscal year. In Dallas, there has been a continuous improvement in the nutritional value of food distributed. In Des Moines, the community's primary food pantry network renewed its commitment to provide nutritious food for low-income consumers. This resulted in distribution of increased quantities of fresh produce, as well as healthy versions of shelf-stable items - low-fat, low-sugar, low-salt foods. Approximately 15 percent of all food distributed through this emergency food pantry network is in the form of fresh fruit and vegetables. In Phoenix, officials have been purchasing more food to meet demand and receiving more fresh produce from national donors. In Los Angeles, the Regional Food Bank continues to add more produce and other foods with high nutritional value. In Saint Paul, Second Harvest Heartland continues to purchase food containing less sodium. In San Francisco, officials have added numerous purchased products to distributions, notably protein items such as eggs and frozen meat, and grains such as pasta and rice.\",\n",

       "    'text': ' S A N F R A N C I S C O \\' S M A I N A T T R A C T I O N S One great way to explore the city is by taking a San Francisco City Tour - The front desk can arrange your tour (with or without a trip to Alcatraz) and have the tour-bus pick you up and drop you off right in front of our Inn. Tickets are available from the front desk. If you so choose, there are also city tours available in the following foreign languages: German, Spanish, Italian, French, Japanese and Korean. The front desk can also provide information on a number of other tour packages to sites outside of San Francisco such as Napa Valley, Sausalito, Muir Woods, and Monterey / Carmel. G o l d e n G a t e B r i d g e - 101 North, Vista Point, $5 Toll. This beautiful old red-orange bridge has become the defining symbol of the Bay Area. The bridge is easy to approach by car or tour bus. Once you\\'re there, walk or bicycle across to slowly savor the experience. There\\'s no bad time to cross the bridge - unless you\\'re a commuter in rush-hour traffic. The views are spectacular by day or night. On the north side, the Vista Point parking lot is free and open every day from 7am to 7pm, but there\\'s a four-hour limit. The Southeast parking lot is metered, so bring some quarters. Vista Point, on the Marin side of the bridge, is one of the most popular picture-taking spots in the Bay Area. F i s h e r m e n \\' s W h a r f - Get up early and greet the sunrise and brisk bay air with a hearty walk on the piers and along Jefferson Street, making sure to take a turn into Fish Alley. Known for its historic waterfront, delicious seafood, spectacular sights and unique shopping, Fisherman\\'s Wharf offers a wide array of things to do for everyone. The opening of crab season in November is a festive occasion. It is the day when the cauldrons along Fisherman\\'s Wharf are lighted, ready to receive the boxes piled high with Dungeness crab hoisted from the decks of the first boats that come chuffing back into port. It is a time for gourmet feasting that will last through the weeks and months to follow. C a b l e C a r s - Hanging off the side as you whiz down hills and around corners is a quintessential San Francisco experience. If you\\'re in San Francisco, you\\'ve got to ride the cable cars at least once. Either hop on a cable car as you walk along its route or pick up the line at either Cable Car turnaround points (located at Fisherman\\'s Wharf & Union Square). The system has been in place since 1873 and there are three unique lines to choose from California, Hyde-Powell and Mason-Powell. With these three unique lines you\\'re able to see the city from a great view. C a b l e C a r B a r n & M u s e u m - This museum displays the history of San Francisco\\'s cable cars and the underground cables that actually pulled the cars along the tracks. Great place to take pictures and learn about the history of the cable cars. (FREE) It is located at 1201 Mason St @ Washington St - 415-474-1887. L o m b a r d S t / C r o o k e d e s t S t r e e t - \"The Crookedest Street in the World\", a moniker stemming from the fact that, in 1922, city engineers crammed eight cobblestone switchbacks into a single steep block of Lombard. The goal was to provide relief from the hair-raising slope; the inadvertent result was a tourist site. Hairpin turns are only part of the attraction. Lombard\\'s crazy-curve block is lined with handsome houses and adorned with copious hydrangeas. The high point, atop Russian Hill, offers stupendous views of the San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz, and the city. Add to this the fact that the Hyde Street cable car deposits visitors at the top of the picturesque incline and the Crookedest Street could hardly have escaped notice. A l c a t r a z - Escape from the mainland to this legendary prison for a thrilling tour behind bars. Perhaps the most famous ex-jail in the world, \"The Rock\" draws thousands. We recommend the Blue and Gold Fleet, departing from Pier 41 up to 16 times a day. Be sure and get the audio tour, a magnificently done pastiche of history and recreation. Alcatraz is Spanish for \"Pelican\". P i e r 3 9 - Carnival-like atmosphere that is as essential to San Francisco\\'s allure as the Golden Gate Bridge. It\\'s a good starting point for all sorts of fun tourist activities. You can purchase any number of items (i.e. t-shirts, postcards, etc.) to prove you were here. The local jugglers and carousel give the area a family-friendly, circus-like atmosphere. It\\'s like stepping into several postcards of our city by the bay. You can spot Alcatraz, the Bay Bridge, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Marin headlands and the tip of the Transamerica building from the center of the pier. With more than 110 stores, 11 full-service restaurants with bay views and numerous fun-filled attractions including arcades, aquariums and snorting sea lions-Pier 39 is enjoyable for the whole family. S A N F R A N C I S C O \\' S M A I N A T T R A C T I O N S - C O N T I N U E D C h i n a t o w n - Much more than a tourist attraction - one of the city\\'s most culturally aware, culinary delectable neighborhoods. With its crowded streets, bustling markets, mysterious alleys, hidden temples and busy restaurants, Chinatown is San Francisco\\'s most colorful neighborhood. It is also among the most famous, and therefore teems with visitors. A formal tour of Chinatown starts at the Chinatown Gateway, a dragon-crowned portal located on the corner of Bush and Grant. Originally known as Dupont Street, the road was notorious for its opium dens and gambling halls. Today, Grant Avenue is notorious for its number of shops selling jade jewelry, clay Buddha statues, electronics and kites. The hustle and bustle of Chinatown\\'s daily life can be found on Stockton Street, where the sights and smells of the herbalist shops and the fish and produce markets recall Shanghai circa 1930. S a n F r a n c i s c o C i t y H a l l - Designed in 1915 by architect Arthur Brown, this French Renaissance-style Beaux Arts landmark is considered by many to be San Francisco\\'s most beautiful structure. The 24-carat gilded dome soars 306 feet above the newly refurbished building, reopened in January 1999. Internal highlights include birdcage elevators, crystal chandeliers, oak paneling and skylights, all of which have survived three fires and a major earthquake. City Hall features art exhibits on the ground floor, including photography, painting and crafts. Free tours highlighting building history, art and architecture are available daily. For more information call the Docent Tour Hotline at 415-554-6023. G o l d e n G a t e P a r k - This Park is most easily accessed off 19th Avenue. Since parking is often difficult, public transportation is the best way to go. Go any day, any time, although Sundays are especially nice because cars are not allowed on John F. Kennedy Drive, the park\\'s main thoroughfare. Golden Gate Park offers gardens, lakes, waterfalls, a Victorian conservatory, a bandstand concourse, the Japanese Tea Garden ($4.00 admission) 8:30 am - 5:30 pm 415-668-0909, a polo field, a golf course, massive lawns and athletic fields, and a first-rate children\\'s playground. P a l a c e O f F i n e A r t s - A remnant of San Francisco\\'s glorious past, this exquisite arts and science complex pulses in the heart of the Marina District. Designed by architect Bernard Maybeck, the Palace of Fine Arts was built in 1915 for the Panama Pacific Exposition that celebrated both the completion of the Panama Canal and the rebirth of San Francisco following the 1906 earthquake. Built as a temporary structure, however, it soon began to crumble and was eventually reconstructed-in a stripped-down version of Maybeck\\'s original-in the early \\'60s. C o i t T o w e r - An eye-catching landmark featuring \"Work Progress Administration\" murals and beautiful views. As a tribute to the men who tried to save San Francisco in 1906, Lilly Coit designated that her legacy be used for the beautification of her beloved city. The views here are spectacular, but if you want to look out from the tower\\'s top, you\\'d best go during daylight, as Coit Tower generally closes at 5pm. Though the mural gallery and gift shop are free, it\\'ll cost you $4.50 for adults and $2.00 for children to ride the elevator to the top. If you don\\'t like heights, look in nearby trees; believe it or not, a flock of wild parrots lives in the neighborhood. For more information call 415-362-0808. S F M O M A - With a finger on technology\\'s pulse, this premier West Coast modern-art venue just keeps getting better. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art put itself back on the map in January 1995, the day it moved downtown into Mario Botta\\'s fab postmodern jewel with the brick facade and striped oculus skylight. The move unleashed an unprecedented flood of important acquisitions and renewed public interest. In addition to showcasing its far-ranging permanent collection, the museum serves as a frequent stopping-off point for prestigious traveling blockbusters. The museum is also a hot spot for the latest digital and high-tech installations. If you really want to see the museum, make a day of it. SF MOMA has the second-largest exhibition space of any modern museum in the country, just behind New York City\\'s Museum of Modern Art. It is located at 151 Third St - 415-357-4000. A s i a n A r t M u s e u m - The Asian Art Museum is one of the largest museums in the Western World devoted exclusively to Asian art. Its holdings include nearly 15,000 treasures spanning 6,000 years of history, representing cultures throughout Asia. The museum\\'s new home is the result of the rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of the city\\'s former Main Library, a 1917 beaux arts-style building. Admission is only $12 for adults, $8 for seniors, $7 for children twelve and up and children under twelve are free. Renowned architect Gae Aulenti oversaw the dramatic transformation of the building which now features 40,000 square feet of gallery space. It is located at 200 Larkin St - 415-581-3500 Sunday-Saturdays. W H A T E L S E I S T H E R E T O D O I N S A N F R A N C I S C O ?

       "    'text': 'Arrival Time The time when the first tsunami wave is observed at a particular location, typically given in local and/or universal time but also commonly noted in minutes or hours relative to time of earthquake. Bathymetry The measurement of water depth of an undisturbed body of water. Cascadia Subduction Zone Fault that extends from Cape Mendocino in Northern California northward to mid-Vancouver Island Canada. The fault marks the convergence boundary where the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate is being sub-ducted under the margin of the North America plate. Current Speed The scalar rate of water motion measured as distance/time. Current Velocity Movement of water expressed as a vector quantity. Velocity is the distance of movement per time coupled with direction of motion. Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART((R))) Tsunami detection and transmission system that measures the pressure of an overlying column of water and detects the passage of a tsunami Digital Elevation Model (DEM) A digital representation of bathymetry or topography based on regional survey data or satellite imagery. Data are arrays of regularly spaced elevations referenced to map projection of geographic coordinate system. Epicenter The point on the surface of the earth that is directly above the focus of an earthquake. Far-field Region outside of the source of a tsunami where no direct observations of the tsunami-generating event are evident, except for the tsunami waves themselves. Focus The point beneath the surface of the earth where a rupture or energy release occurs due to a build up of stress or the movement of earth\\'s tectonic plates relative to one another. Inundation The horizontal inland extent of land that a tsunami penetrates, generally measured perpendicularly to a shoreline. 86 Marigram Tide gauge recording of wave level as a function of time at a particular location. The instrument used for recording is termed marigraph. Moment Magnitude (MW) The magnitude of an earthquake on a logarithmic scale in terms of the energy released. Moment magnitude is based on the size and characteristics of a fault rupture as determined from long-period seismic waves. Method of Splitting Tsunamis (MOST) A suite of numerical simulation codes used to provide estimates of the three processes of tsunami evolution: tsunami generation, propagation, and inundation. Near-field Region of primary tsunami impact near the source of the tsunami. The near-field is defined as the region where non-tsunami effects of the tsunami-generating event have been observed, such as earth shaking from the earthquake, visible or measured ground deformation, or other direct (non-tsunami) evidences of the source of the tsunami wave. Propagation database A basin-wide database of pre-computed water elevations and flow velocities at uniformly spaced grid points throughout the world Oceans. Values are computed from tsunamis generated by earthquakes with a fault rupture at any one of discrete 100 X 50 km unit sources along worldwide subduction zones. Runup or Run-up Vertical difference between the elevation of tsunami inundation and the sea level at the time of a tsunami. Runup is the elevation of the highest point of land inundated by a tsunami as measured relative to a stated datum, such as mean sea level. Short-term Inundation Forecasting for Tsunamis (SIFT) A tsunami forecast system that integrates tsunami observations in the deep-ocean with numerical models to provide an estimate of tsunami wave arrival, amplitude, at specific coastal locations while a tsunami propagates across an ocean basin. Subduction zone A submarine region of the earth\\'s crust at which two or more tectonic plates converge to cause one plate to sink under another, overriding plate. Subduction zones are regions of high seismic activity. Synthetic event Hypothetical events based on computer simulations or theory of possible or even likely future scenarios. Tidal wave Term frequently used incorrectly as a synonym for tsunami. A tsunami is unrelated to the predictable periodic rise and fall of sea level due to the gravitational attractions of the moon and sun: the tide. Tide The predictable rise and fall of a body of water (ocean, sea, bay, etc.) due to the gravitational attractions of the moon and sun. 7 Tide Gauge An instrument for measuring the rise and fall of a column of water over time at a particular location. Tele-tsunami or distant tsunami Most commonly, a tsunami originating from a source greater than 1000 km away from a particular location. In some contexts, a tele-tsunami is one that propagates through deep-ocean before reaching a particular location without regard to distance separation. Travel time The time it takes for a tsunami to travel from the generating source to a particular location. Tsunameter An oceanographic instrument used to detect and measure tsunamis in the deep-ocean. Tsunami measurements are typically transmitted acoustically to a surface buoy that in turn relays them in real-time to ground stations via satellite. Tsunami A Japanese term that literally translates to \"harbor wave.\" Tsunamis are a series of long period shallow water waves that are generated by the sudden displacement of water due to subsea disturbances such as earthquakes, submarine landslides, or volcanic eruptions. Less commonly, meteoric impact to the ocean or meteorological forcing can generate a tsunami. Tsunami Hazard Assessment A systematic investigation of seismically active regions of the world oceans to determine their potential tsunami impact at a particular location. Numerical models are typically used to characterize tsunami generation, propagation, and inundation and to quantify the risk posed a particular community from tsunamis generated in each source region investigated. Tsunami Magnitude A number that characterizes the strength of a tsunami based on the tsunami wave amplitudes. Several different tsunami magnitude determination methods have been proposed. Tsunami Propagation The directional movement of a tsunami wave outward from the source of generation. The speed at which a tsunami propagates depends on the depth of the water column in which the wave is traveling. Tsunamis travel at a speed of 700 km/hr (450 mi/hr) over the average depth of 4000 m in the open deep Pacific Ocean. Tsunami Source Abrupt deformation of the ocean surface that generates series of long gravity waves propagating outward from the source area. The deformation is typically produced by underwater earthquakes, landslide, volcano eruptions or other catastrophic geophysical processes. Wave amplitude The maximum vertical rise or drop of a column of water as measured from wave crest (peak) or trough to a defined mean water level state. 88 Wave crest or peak The highest part of a wave or maximum rise above a defined mean water level state, such as mean lower low water. Wave height The vertical difference between the highest part of a specific wave (crest) and it\\'s corresponding lowest point (trough). Wavelength The horizontal distance between two successive wave crests or troughs. Wave period The length of time between the passage of two successive wave crests or troughs as measured at a fixed location. Wave trough The lowest part of a wave or the maximum drop below a defined mean water level state, such as mean lower low water.',\n",

       "    'text': \"It is evident that San Francisco will continue to need to be inventive and its housing advocates strong to meet the challenges ahead. Some advocates are already looking beyond the Trust Fund to the new frontier of housing policy. Building on development limitation and job-housing balance ideas from Proposition M and the phasing and linkage of different types of development demanded by the more equitable and inclusive recent redevelopment projects, they are formulating a plan to link approval of market-rate housing to meet the afford- ability goals set by ABAG described above. San Francisco continues to evolve its policy to fill in the gaps in its housing needs and find creative and substantial sources of funding to develop and maintain affordable housing. By also ensuring that the needs of local residents are heard, San Francisco is demonstrating that the early urban renewal and displacement days are gone and have been replaced with a vision of creating the housing, jobs and services required to maintain and rebuild vibrant, diverse and thriving communities within the City. The interaction of dedicated community advocacy and strong coalitions, availability of substantial funding sources, and housing programs that are responsive to community needs and market changes have resulted in the successful evolution of affordable housing programs in San Francisco. While these factors generated the City's most influential programs, their presence does not guarantee a successful result. For example, in 1981, San Francisco adopted an Apartment Unit Conversion and Demolition Ordinance that prohibits the conversion of apartments to tourist or transient use.190 The conversion from apartment to tourist or transient use, particularly of rent-controlled apartments, especially impacts low- to moderate-income households, displaces existing tenants, and decreases the already limited number of units available to serve these families. This ordinance resulted from the same development pressures and organized tenant movement that culminated in the Rent Stabilization, Condominium Conversion, and Residential Hotel Demolition and Conversion ordinances adopted in 1979 and 1980.191 Unlike these ordinances, however, the apartment conversion ordinance has not been successful in meeting its purpose, which is to stop apartments from becoming corporate suites, timeshares, surrogate hotel units or other non permanent housing uses. The primary problem has been lack of enforcement. Because such conversions most often occur without any formal regulatory process, they are hard to identify and regulate. The ordinance itself relies on a complaint from a displaced permanent tenant of an unlawful conversion to initiate an investigation by the Department of Building Inspection. Investigation often entails visiting the property at night and other measures to prove conversion, requiring extra resources and staff that has not been provided. In the face of the revived dot.com boom this decade, however, the conversion of long term rentals to short term tourist and transient uses has again hit the forefront of tenant concerns in San Francisco,192 prompting yet another look at the ordinance.193 Also, before implementing some of San Francisco's successes in other communities, it is important to recognize that housing programs are shaped by state and local laws, as well as market forces unique to each situation. For example, some states may prohibit rent control of privately-owned rental units. This means that, even if the necessary community, political and economic factors are in place, adopting a Rent Control and Stabilization Ordinance just\",\n",

       "    'text': ' The Department of Veterans Affairs has set a goal of ending homelessness among veterans by the end of 2015. HUD and VA continue to fund efforts such as the HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program, which provides permanent, supportive housing and treatment services for homeless veterans; the VA Homeless Grant and Per Diem Program, which funds community-based agencies providing transitional housing or service centers for homeless veterans; and the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) Program, which awards grants to private non-profit organizations and consumer cooperatives who can provide supportive services to very low-income veteran families living in or transitioning to permanent housing. Last year\\'s Point-in-Time count of homeless persons showed a drop of 7 percent in the homeless veterans population between 2011 and 2012 - the continuation of a positive year-to-year trend. This year, as cited earlier in this report, HUD says a 24.2 percent drop in the number of homeless veterans has occurred between 2010 and 2013. Large numbers of young veterans in the homeless population continue to be a particular concern among veterans\\' advocates, however. The VA reported a year ago that the number in this category had increased significantly over previous years, in part because of more aggressive efforts to identify and assist these veterans, and in part because of the combat-related problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse that make adjustment to civilian life more difficult. The combined troop commitment in Iraq and Afghanistan continues to drop, and it\\'s estimated that more than 300,000 troops are likely to separate from the military in each of the next few years. In addition, because of current and projected cuts in defense spending, the military is preparing for large-scale troop cuts over the next few years, and accelerating reductions in personnel could make additional involuntary personnel reductions more likely. In this year\\'s survey, city officials were asked to describe the status of efforts to serve the homeless veterans\\' population in their cities. All of the survey cities except Plano and Trenton have been successful in obtaining HUD, VA and other funds targeted to homeless veterans. Officials in nearly four in five (79 percent) of the cities report their efforts to target homeless veterans have been successful in reducing the number of veterans in the homeless population. Following are their comments on some of the programs they have used and the results they have achieved: Asheville, Santa Barbara, and Washington, DC have used VASH vouchers and the SSVF Program, and Santa Barbara also has used the Grant and Per Diem Program. Boston has seen a 6 percent reduction in the number of veterans in emergency shelters and a 3 percent overall decrease in the number of homeless veterans. Charleston reports that 549 persons in veteran families being served by the SSVF Program exited to permanent housing. Charlotte officials cite an increase in the number of VASH vouchers, prioritization of veterans, and increased outreach efforts as reasons for their success. Cleveland says chronically homeless veterans have been targeted as part of the Housing First Initiative, which provides permanent supportive housing for long-term homeless individuals. Louisville officials say there has been a 20 percent decrease in homeless veterans over the past year. Nashville says its most recent Point-in-Time count indicates the number of \"chronic\" homeless veterans living on the streets in Nashville-Davidson County has been reduced to 67. They caution, however, that this does not include those homeless veterans who come to Nashville \"day in and day out.\" The need for housing is still great among those sheltered and unsheltered, as well as among at-risk veterans and veterans\\' families. Norfolk officials report that Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Portsmouth and Western Tidewater have committed to housing veterans. The waitlist for the newest permanent supportive housing development, South Bay, which has 60 units of permanent supportive housing, includes a veterans\\' preference. Saint Paul reports that in 2012, the Minnesota Assistance Council for Veterans provided intensive case management and direct services to 74 veterans and families in Ramsey County, the majority of these were from Saint Paul. They point out that the average cost to prevent homelessness is $500-$700 for each veteran served, and that re-housing services costs can be much higher, depending on the individual veteran\\'s situation. Salt Lake City officials report that they are getting close to meeting the goal of zero chronically homeless vets. San Antonio reports that 65-70 percent of veterans leaving transitional housing are entering permanent housing. San Francisco says there has been a 30 percent reduction of homeless veterans from 2011 to 2013, according to its Point-in-Time homeless count. Eighty-eight percent (22) of the cities report their efforts to target homeless veterans have been successful in other ways. Their comments: Through outreach, Asheville has increased the number of homeless veterans receiving VA healthcare. In Boston, coordination across multiple agencies has increased throughout the Continuum of Care. Officials say that this has helped in targeting HUD-VASH resources to the chronically homeless and others in need of housing. The addition of VA Peer Specialists through the VA health care system and Massachusetts Department of Veterans Services has increased both outreach and \"inreach\" to veterans living on the streets or in shelters. New Supportive Services for Veterans and Families funding has helped provide critical homelessness prevention or upfront housing resources for security deposits or first and last month\\'s rent. In Charleston, Crisis Ministries currently operates 14 transitional housing beds for male veterans and 10 for female veterans, and additional beds for male veterans will open next year. This program provides services to assist these veterans in their transition into permanent housing and self-sufficiency. Charlotte has developed a streamlined application process with permanent supportive housing providers. Cleveland has two new VA programs for homeless veterans: the Community Resource and Referral Center (CRRC) which links veterans to health, housing, and treatment services, and the SSFV Program funded by the VA through a local non-profit. Denver has housed 100 veterans though the \"100 Veterans in 100 Days\" campaign. In Los Angeles, homeless veterans (3,439) currently account for 16 percent of the homeless population. The Los Angeles Business Leaders Task Force, the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County adopted the Home for Good Plan to end veteran and chronic homelessness by creating 1,700 permanent supportive housing units. Louisville has increased partnerships with agencies serving veterans. Nashville has housed over 400 homeless veterans and families through its HUD-VASH housing program in Davidson County and surrounding middle Tennessee. This signifies tremendous growth, up from 22 veterans served in 2007. There are currently 230 homeless veterans housed in VA-funded Grant and Per Diem transitional housing programs in Davidson County and surrounding middle Tennessee and Kentucky counties. Many Davidson County homeless veterans housed also benefit from VA programs in other areas outside Nashville/Davidson County. In Norfolk, the commitment to housing veterans has been successful in continuing partnerships with veteran service providers and with organizations through the 100,000 Homes initiative. Philadelphia has been designated one of 10 Dedicating Opportunities to End Homelessness (DOEH) communities by HUD and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. DOEH supports community leaders so that they can make greater progress in addressing homelessness. Housing targets and strategies are set using an analytic tool (Strategic Planning Guide). Philadelphia used this to project gaps and to identify housing resources to close the gaps and end chronic and veteran homelessness. In addition, Philadelphia participated in the Rapid Results Institute sponsored by Community Solutions (100,000 Homes) to build a local team to end veteran homelessness. This is leading to new housing commitments and processes to ensure that veterans are identified, targeted, and offered housing solutions more quickly. HUD-VA resources have been provided, most notably SSVF funding and a total of 460 VASH vouchers. The 2012 and 2013 Point-in-Time counts, however, indicated a 10 percent increase in homeless veterans. In Providence, while more veterans have been placed in permanent housing using HUD-VASH vouchers, the overall numbers of homeless veterans have not changed much. In San Antonio, employment and training programs show that those homeless veterans who obtain and maintain employment also obtain and maintain permanent housing. San Francisco, through its partnership with and support from the 100,000 Homes campaign, has strengthened community-wide collaboration among the City, the VA, HUD, the Housing Authority, and a number of nonprofit organizations. Most recently, the group was successful in a campaign to house 100 chronically homeless veterans in 100 days-surpassing that goal and housing 110. Santa Barbara is assisting veterans to enter transitional shelter and participating in Stand Down, the VA health program.',\n",

       "    'text': \"In order to gather in-depth accounts of how law enforcement interactions affected a diverse group of homeless San Franciscans, five peer researchers conducted video-recorded (and in five cases only audio-recorded) oral history interviews with an additional sample of 43 currently homeless participants. Interviews explored participants' histories of homelessness and experiences with law enforcement, including experiences with displacement from public space, police searches, citations, and arrest and incarceration. Questions focused on the effects of the criminalization of homelessness and the relationship between homelessness and incarceration. Interviews were not anonymous, but participants could choose to use pseudonyms. Informed consent practices drew from the best practices of the Oral History Association of America37 and the COH's own consent process for video-recording. A team of five currently and recently homeless peer researchers conducted all of the interviews. Peer researchers received training in interview methods from sociologists affiliated with the UC Berkeley Center for Human Rights and UCSD Center for Global Justice. In addition to completing 8 hours of formal methodological training, each peer researcher received on-going data collection support. One goal of this project was to empower homeless people to create and disseminate knowledge as experts in the homelessness poli- 37 Available at http://www.oralhistory.org/about/principles-and-practices/ cy field. Peer researchers learned how to approach interview interactions in a neutral and non-judgmental way. At the end of each interview, peer researchers reflected with interview participants about how participants' experiences could inform the COH's campaigns and policy recommendations. Peer researchers recruited interview participants from their own communities, with a focus on race and gender diversity within the interview sample. People could participate in interviews if they were currently homeless or housed in SRO hotels and had interacted with law enforcement in San Francisco. Peer researchers administered pre-interview surveys to each participant and chose the most relevant interview questions from the interview guide. Most interviews lasted between 40 minutes and one hour, and interview participants received a $20 Safeway gift card. Qualitative data analysis was an on-going process, with weekly research team meetings to discuss data collection and analysis. During the month of May, the lead members of the Peer Research Team transcribed the interviews and coded the data according to broad themes that emerged from prior analysis of survey data. Working with sociologists, peer researchers and the Human Rights Work Group analyzed recurring themes in the interview data, and selected personal accounts to be presented in this report. Collaborative data analysis gave homeless communities control over portrayals of their lives and experiences. Likewise the recommendations of this report are not those of the academic authors or research associates, but rather those of the Human Rights Workgroup in reflection of the empirical findings presented here.\",\n",

       "    'text': 'Rising sea levels will be among the most significant impacts of climate change to California. Sea level will rise as a result of thermal expansion of the oceans and an increase in ocean volume as land ice melts and runs off into the ocean. Over the past century, sea level has risen nearly eight inches along the California coast, and general circulation model scenarios suggest very substantial increases in sea level due to climate change over the coming century. We estimate that sea level rise will put 220,000 and 270,000 people at risk of a 100-year flood event with a 1.0 m and 1.4 m rise in sea levels, respectively. Among those affected are large numbers of low-income people and communities of color, which are especially vulnerable. A wide range of critical infrastructure, such as roads, hospitals, schools, emergency facilities, wastewater treatment plants, power plants, and wetlands is also vulnerable. In addition, $49 billion to $62 billion (in year 2000 dollars) worth of property is at risk of coastal flooding with a 1.0 and 1.4 m rise in sea levels, respectively. A number of structural and non-structural policies and actions could be implemented to reduce these risks. Continued development in vulnerable areas will put additional people and assets at risk and raise protection costs. 21 Determining what to protect, how to pay for it, and how those choices are made raises concerns over equity and environmental justice.',\n",

       "    'text': 'The \"Old Adobe, built in 1844,\" served as the customhouse in San Francisco under both Mexican and U.S. authorities The \"Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,\" the legal instrument by which much of the southwest of this country formally passed into the possession of the United States, was signed in Mexico City on February 2, 1848, less than a fortnight after the discovery of gold in California. Dictated by the victorious Americans after twenty months of war, the treaty essentially ratified de jure the possession by the United States of territories secured over previous years variously by immigration of its nationals and by force of arms. The sleepy village of Yerba Buena, today\\'s San Francisco, had fallen under U.S. control in July 1846 when 250 Marines from the USS Portsmouth came ashore and raised the American flag over the pueblo\\'s principal square, such as it was. During this period of westward expansion, one of the first orders of business in a newly-acquired territory was to bring the local economy, licit and illicit, to heel, and to establish a revenue stream, which generally meant a system of Customs collections and enforcement. In San Francisco, responsibility for this briefly fell to William Antonio Richardson (1795-1858), an English-born sailor who served as harbormaster for San Francisco Bay under the Mexican government. He built a modest one-story adobe structure that became known as \"La Casa Grande,\" as it was the most substantial building in town outside of the Presidio proper. Since the building had served unofficially as the settlement\\'s customhouse for some years by the time the Americans arrived, the function was formalized, and the \"Old Adobe\" as it was by then called, became the center of Customs business under U.S. military authority. Richardson was replaced in 1847 by U.S. Army Captain Joseph L. Folsom, who was to serve as the military Collector of Customs until the first tumultuous months of the Gold Rush. 4 The first \"permanent\" U.S. customhouse in San Francisco is seen at left during ceremonies marking California\\'s admission to the Union in September 1850 Half a year elapsed before news of the California goldfields began to spread round the world. Once the world took notice, over a quarter of a million fortune-hunters descended on the state over the next half-decade from the U.S., Europe, Latin America and as far away as China and Australia. As the jumping-off point for most of these hopeful prospectors, San Francisco suddenly endured a huge surge in its population. The town had counted approximately two hundred souls at the beginning of 1846. By the end of the decade some 25,000 people jostled for space in the infant metropolis. With little domestic industry, San Francisco was obliged to ship in virtually everything its merchants could offer for resale. The practical and administrative requirements of Customs had outgrown both the laissez-faire approach and the physical plant bequeathed by Captain Richardson to the new American authorities. In June of 1850, Customs operations, now under the civilian control of the U.S. Customs Service, relocated to a newly-built four story brick building at the corner of Montgomery and California Streets, with James L. Collier, the region\\'s first non-military Collector of Customs, presiding over tariff collections. As one of the most imposing edifices in the town-not, at that period, a particularly difficult bar to clear-it was the object of considerable civic pride, and Collector Collier actually arranged to have the original flagpole from \"La Casa Grande\" moved to the new location as a symbol of institutional continuity. Unfortunately, within twelve months one of the major fires that periodically swept the city during its early years claimed this customhouse, including the historic flagpole. 5 The first Customhouse on Battery Street, circa 1867, after undergoing possibly the earliest \"seismic retrofit\" ever conducted on U.S. territory. The building survived a strong earthquake in 1868, although the projecting portico at the front separated from the rest of the structure and was subsequently pulled down. 6',\n",

       "    'text': '36 Way), that followed the line of the old Park & Ocean train; the #17 line down 20th Avenue, which acted as successor to the Parkside Transit Company\\'s first line; and the #12 line along Sloat Boulevard from Ocean Avenue. Inadequate service from these lines impeded development up to the 1920s, as all three lines had to wind through several neighborhoods of the city before reaching downtown.123 The opening of the Municipal Railway streetcar lines through Twin Peaks Tunnel in 1918 and the Sunset tunnel in 1928 greatly improved commute times and access. In the meantime, the automobile had evolved from a rich man\\'s toy into affordable transportation for the middle class. A 1913 article, \"The Automobile and Its Mission,\" summarized the astounding progress of the auto age: in 1908 it was still a \"transcendent play thing-thrilling, seductive, desperately expensive.\" By 1913, it was opening up a new pattern of residential development.124 The first mass produced car, Henry Ford\\'s Model T, revolutionized travel. The Model T cost $850 in 1908, less than half what cars cost at the time. By the 1920s, the price had fallen to $300.125 Auto registration in San Francisco tripled from 12,000 in 1914 to 31,817 in 1917 and tripled again to 103,341 in 1924. By 1930, there were 155,888 autos registered in San Francisco.126 The automobile allowed less valuable land farther away from streetcar lines to be practical for house sites. After World War I, the developers of the Sunset foresaw the dominance of the automobile and laid out their sites with the auto in mind.127 Architect and researcher Ken Zinns noted that although the distance, from property line to property line, across a street in the Sunset is nearly identical to that in the Haight-Ashbury (developed in the 1880s before cars): \"the actual width of the street surface is about twelve feet wider in the Sunset, as the sidewalks are much narrower. The additional width allowed on-street parking, while still leaving plenty of room for traffic. All the various row-house forms had very similar relationships to the street. All were set back from ten to fifteen feet from the front property line. This allowed autos to be parked in the driveways without blocking the street. It also made the streets appear wider and the buildings lower than they actually are, since the buildings were farther apart. This created a streetscape much different from older parts of the city, an almost suburban streetscape where the auto clearly has dominance over the pedestrian. There are no 123 http://www.streetcar.org/mim/spotlight/yesterday/sunset/index.html, accessed September 6, 2007. 124 Robert Stein, ed, The Anglo American Suburb, London, England: Architectural Design, 1981, page 11. 125 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T, accessed September 4, 2007. 126 Ring, pages 56, 100, 101. 127 By 1970 the residents were much less likely to use Muni daily (19%) than they were a car (81%).

Parkside Garage, 1830 Taraval Street. 37 real gestures to the pedestrian along the street, no stoop entries, no front yards, no street trees.\"128 Since the 25-foot wide lots precluded room for a driveway along the side, as was common in suburban lots of the period, high basements were provided so they could be used as garages.129 Housing construction west of Twin Peaks was slow up to the end of World War I. When house construction boomed nationwide in the 1920s, San Francisco mirrored the trend.130 By this time, the Shingle and Craftsman styles had been surpassed by the Sunset house type, which provided an integral garage. Prominent developers of the Parkside and Sunset from the 1920s to 1950s were the Gellerts (Sunstream Homes and Standard Building Company), Henry Doelger, Ray Galli, Lang Realty Company, Chris McKeon (Happy Homes Building Company), and the Meyer brothers.131 These merchant builders did not resemble the community builders who comprehensively planned developments such as Duncan McDuffie in St. Francis Wood or Harry B. Allen in Sea Cliff.132 Instead, they were often family-run businesses concerned with building affordable houses quickly on the standard city grid in a range of facades to suit current tastes.133 None of these builders employed architects, although they did use building designers.134 The builders borrowed ideas from one another and kept track of which floor plans and facade styles were selling best. Before World War II, styles were a mixture of Spanish (red tile roofs), Second Empire, English Tudor, and Colonial. After the war, period revival detailing was less common, both to control costs and to offer a \"modern\" look. The results are houses that are so similar it is difficult to identify the builder.135 128 Zinns, page 16. 129 In San Francisco row houses, \"basements\" usually are at grade in contrast to the typical definition of a basement as a space below grade. 130 Carolyn S. Loeb, Entrepreneurial Vernacular, Developers\\' Subdivision in the 1920s, Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 2001, page 6. 131 Zinns credits the Gellerts with building 20,000 houses in San Francisco between 1920 and 1945 and Doelger with building 25,000 houses, mostly in the Sunset. Daniel Gregory states that the Gellerts and Doelger produced the \"lion\\'s share\" of the houses in the Sunset: Daniel Gregory, \"Be It Ever So Humble: The Impact of the Merchant Builder-Land Developer on the Evolution of Housing in the Bay Area,\" Department of Architecture, University of California 1979, page 10. 132 Marc A. Weiss, The Rise of the Community Builders, New York: Columbia University Press, 1987, pages 2, 51, 58, 120. The Doelger and Gellert companies did engage in community planning and development in later years with Daly City\\'s Westlake and Serramonte areas. 133 The Gellerts did consult with the Parkside District Improvement Club on zoning and development plans and even had a family member on that organization\\'s board.

Photo 2007. 38 2601-31st Avenue. November 2007 photo. Generally, houses were built for middle-class, first-time buyers, with prices from $4,500 to $7,000. Building increased tremendously in the late 1920s and fell off briefly in the early 1930s before picking up again, reaching a peak in 1939. By this time, rows of houses were built across the sand dunes. While early real estate maps indicated plans to plat and develop the Stern Grove, Pine Lake Park, and even the reserved city parkland of McCoppin Square and Parkside Square, these parks were never encroached upon. With the addition of, and improvements to Larsen Park, the landscaped strips along Sunset Boulevard, and the Lake Merced area in the 1920s and 1930s, Parkside offered a high percentage of open space compared to older San Francisco neighborhoods. The relatively small homes built by cost-mindful developers also created larger than average backyards for city residents. Shops and services grew along Taraval Street, and boomed with housing construction in the 1920s. The first two bank branches and the Parkside District\\'s only movie theater opened near the intersection of 20th and Taraval in 1927.136 The primary shopping area for the Parkside extended from 17th Avenue to 24th Avenue on Taraval. Stores and businesses sprang up more or less spontaneously along the L streetcar line during the 1920s to serve the growing population, a typical pattern in the Bay Area.137 A subsidiary shopping area also grew along Vicente Street between 22nd and 24th Avenues. During this time, the Parkside\\'s larger institutional buildings were constructed: a new Parkside School, the San Francisco Protestant Orphanage cottages and Pinehurst Home for Children. Further information on the latter two is in this statement\\'s \"Notable Buildings\" section. After World War II, new Parkside civic and community build- ings followed the popular \"moderne\" styles of the time. The Parkside Branch Library (Taraval and 22nd Avenue), post office (Taraval and 28th Avenue), and First United Presbyterian church (1740 Sloat) are examples. The modernist American Seed and Nursery Company building at 1550 Taraval Street (no longer extant) was even featured in national magazines. Demographic Patterns Development of San Francisco\\'s newer residential areas in the early 20th century often followed previous demographic patterns. The new \"high class\" districts of Forest Hill (1912) and St. Francis Wood (1912) were continuations of the professional and upper middle class found in Nob Hill and Pacific Heights. The Richmond was an extension of the middle class living in the Western Addition, and the Outer Mission/Excelsior was populated by the skilled workers and lower middle-class Irish, Italians, and Germans of the Mission District. 136 \"Sunset to Get New Buildings,\" San Francisco Chronicle, August 20, 1927. 137 James E. Vance, Jr., Geography and Urban Evolution in the San Francisco Bay Area, Institute of Governmental Studies, University of California, Berkeley, 1964, page 53. 39 April 3, 1926 ad from San Francisco Chronicle. 40 Development in the Parkside and Sunset was fueled by a desire to own a house, and the builders responded with single-minded focus. The Parkside grew into a heterogeneous area of single family homes inhabited by Irish-Americans, and others of western European descent from the 1920s through the 1940s.138 The creation of the Federal Housing Administration in 1934 encouraged home ownership with low down payments and long-term mortgages at a time when economic activity had slumped during the first years of the Depression. This greatly spurred the construction and sales of houses in the Sunset/Parkside, and especially the building of single-family homes. The construction and establishment of businesses, flats, and apartment structures lagged, so that by 1939, the Sunset had between 60% and 80% home ownership, while the Inner Richmond and Inner Sunset had figures between 20% and 40% and the Western Addition and Haight-Ashbury Districts were below 20%.139 After World War II, returning servicemen looked to the Park-side as a more attractive place to raise families than their boyhood homes in the Mission District. After both World War II and the Korean War, a flood of Irish left the Mission for the Parkside: \"The Mission is too crowded and has been for 50 years. It wasn\\'t just status an Irishman was seeking when he moved to the Parkside. He wanted a yard, with some grass, and a park near by. The Mission had the climate, but it wasn\\'t the place to raise a family. Nobody wants his kids playing in the street.\"140 The desire to own a house with a yard was the key driver of development in the Parkside. From the earliest days, through the booming 1920s, the Depression of the 1930s, and the hordes of returning servicemen after WWII, builders produced affordable houses in large numbers for first-time buyers. By 1970, the Parkside had matured into a solid middle-class district. Sixty-nine percent of the land area in the Parkside was residential (compared with 39% citywide) and only 3% was commercial (compared to 6% citywide). The housing stock was overwhelming single-family (97% vs. 68% citywide) and owner occupied (81% vs. 31% citywide). Still largely of European descent (85% white, compared with 57% citywide)141 and married (the highest percentage of married persons in the city), the Parkside was the most politically conservative and homogenous district in San Francisco. In the 1975 mayor\\'s race, 65% of the Parkside voted for the more conservative 138 Cherny, page 79. Minutes from the PDIC meetings often list \"Irish songs and jokes told.\" See PDIC Scrapbooks, Volume 1. 139 Zinns, page 18. 140 Eneas J.

       "    'text': '! Local planning organizations or \"Continuums of Care\" in 3,000 cities and counties across the nation conduct one-night counts of their sheltered and unsheltered homeless populations, which are reported to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development each year. Based on this Point-in-Time estimateof persons homeless on a single night in January 2013, HUD reports that the 610,042 people found to be homeless that night represented a 6.1 percent reduction from January 2010, which was the year the federal government established \"Opening Doors,\" a multi-agency strategic plan to end homelessness. Sixty-four percent of these homeless persons were individuals; 36 percent were in family households. Sixty-five percent of those experiencing homelessness were living in emergency shelters or transitional housing programs; 35 percent were living in unsheltered locations such as under bridges, in cars, or in abandoned buildings. The January 2013 count found 57,849 homeless veterans, which represented a 24.2 percent drop from January 2010. Chronic homelessness among individuals declined by 15.7 percent during this period, homelessness among individuals declined nearly 4.9 percent, and homelessness among persons in family households declined by 8.2 percent. The decline in veteran homelessness is largely attributed to the close collaboration between HUD and the Department of Veterans Affairs on a joint HUD-VA Supportive Housing Program (HUD-VASH). Since 2008, HUD reports, a total of 58,250 rental vouchers have been awarded and 43,371 formerly homeless veterans are currently in homes of their own because of this program. HUD says the decline in chronic homelessness is partially attributable to \"a long-standing push to develop more permanent supportive housing opportunities for those struggling with long-term homelessness who otherwise continually cycle from shelters to the streets.\" In its State of Homelessness in America 2013, The National Alliance to End Homelessness uses HUD\\'s January 2012 Point-in-Time data (633,782 found homeless that year) to illustrate proportions of major homeless subpopulations: 46.5 percent non-chronic individuals, 37.8 percent people in families, and 15.8 percent chronic individuals. The report shows that, while most experiencing homelessness are sheltered in emergency shelters or transitional housing, 38 percent of those homeless in January 2012 were living unsheltered on the street or \"other places not meant for human habitation.\" This section of the report provides information on the numbers and types of people experiencing homelessness in the Task Force survey cities and on the availability of emergency shelter across these cities between September 1, 2012 and August 31, 2013. It also includes brief descriptions of exemplary programs and efforts underway in the cities which respond to the problems of homelessness, and concludes with city officials\\' outlook on problems of homelessness in the coming year.',\n",

       "    'text': \" Introduction With aging infrastructure and limited budgets, municipalities have a difficult task of managing their systems while maintaining a desired level of service to their customers. Asset management planning is a tool many wastewater districts are starting to use to manage their sewer systems. South San Francisco's wastewater collection system includes about 120 miles of sewer pipelines, serving a population of 65,547. The sewer system averages a daily dry flow of 8.3 MGD and an average daily wet flow of 10.8 MGD. Aging infrastructure and limited budgets have caused more cities to turn to asset management planning to uphold current levels of service. The city implemented a Sewer System Management Plan for their sewer system in 2005 to comply with the State of California's General Waste Discharge Requirements. Part of the plan is to do a risk management of the system which looks at where failure would have the greatest impact. By knowing which assets are more prone to failure they can be monitored more and replaced before they fail. Sanitary Sewer Asset Management Goals To maintain a set level of service, the city established a list of goals they wanted to fulfill as part of their asset management plan. The goals of South San Francisco's Sanitary Sewer Asset Management Plan are to: Properly manage and operate the city facilities to minimize SSOs. Implement regular, proactive maintenance of the system to prevent blockages that may cause sewer backups or SSOs. Provide adequate capacity to convey peak wastewater flows. Protect public health and safety. Perform all activities in accordance with safety policies and practices. Protect bay wasters and tributaries within the city's service area. Retain qualified employees who are well trained and certified in Collection System Maintenance. Uphold city standards and specifications on newly constructed public and private sewers. Preserve the city's capital investment in the sanitary system to assure maximum system service life. In order to achieve their goals, the city conducted risk management, asset condition, maintenance, and financial management analyses. Risk Management & Asset Condition Assessments South San Francisco maintains a GIS database and maps of its sanitary sewer assets. This information is used for tracking maintenance, service requests, work orders, SSO history, cleaning, repairs, and inspections. The city used the NASSCO standards and history of the system to evaluate the value of their system. The city has implemented a FOG program since 1998 for food service establishments and found that 72% of the food service establishments have grease removal devices in operation. As a result of their asset condition assessment, beginning in 2010 the city has required all building permits for facilities that have grease generating activities to install a grease interceptor. Additionally, the city has increased inspections and enforcement while distributing FOG management pamphlets and other educational materials to minimize the amount of FOG in the sewer system. Maintenance Analysis and Planning Prior to implementing their sewer system management plan, the city had maintained their collection system using a simple routine cleaning schedule. Now, with help of new technology, the city has implemented a more sophisticated strategic cleaning schedules. The city has a Computer Maintenance Management System that tracks maintenance activities, service requests, work orders, SSO history, sewer line cleaning, sewer line and manhole repairs, sewer line CCTV inspections, gravity and force mains and sewer line rehabilitation and replacement projects. Hot Spot Cleaning Work Plan (HSCWP) identifies system pipeline problems and uses the best method to resolve the issue. The HSCWP uses the observations of the cleaning crews to know the condition of the assets. Cleaning schedules consist of quarterly, 6 month and annual cleanings, with the frequency depending on the asset's history of blockages. Manholes are also inspected during pipe cleanings and pump stations are inspected daily and monitored 24/7. These programs allow the system to operate at the intended design flow by preventing backups. This has enhanced the performance of the system, lowered O&M costs, extending the life of the sewer system, and lowered repair, rehabilitation, and replacement costs. In addition to blockage history, cleaning of lines is also based on inspection data, pipe age, material and slope that would indicate frequent cleaning is needed. In 2013, 15-20 miles of the system was inspected with video and 60 miles of the system was cleaned. The city wants to inspect and clean more of their system every year so that they can maintain the same level of service to their customers. Financial Management The sewer system is funded through a sewer enterprise fund, which is composed into four different funds. The Non-Major Governmental Funds are fees paid by developers used to fund capital expenditures that improve the sewer infrastructure. The Major Government Funds are revenues and expenditures associated with the acquisition, construction or improvement of city owned assets. The Proprietary Funds are user charges supporting the operation, maintenance, and capital renovation of the sewer system. The Non-Major Proprietary Funds are revenues paid by users for first time connections to the sewer system or by users who increase their sanitary sewage use. The Operation and Maintenance of the system costs $1.7 million annually. Factors that affect the operational costs of the system include the history of the system, hiring new employees, using new processes, and buying new equipment. As technology advances the operation costs of the system will fluctuate. An example of this is that the city bought a new machine that does spot repairs in the sewer system. The initial costs was high but the cost of each repair is cheaper, because no digging is required. By integrating financial projections, initial capital costs were justified to increase short-term budget in order to minimize long-term expenditure. Results Implementing an asset management system has resulted in numerous benefits for the City of South San Francisco including the ability to manage their system in real time, the establishment of a more proactive maintenance plan, and the ease of being able to quickly access information previously unavailable. The largest overall benefit, however, has been the gradual system performance improvements as a result of asset preservation and replacement. U.S. EPA has a strong interest in working with State regulators and municipalities to find solutions to encourage asset management planning for stormwater, wastewater, and drinking water systems. EPA is encouraged by the progress demonstrated by the City of South San Francisco and hopes to work with other municipalities and regulators to achieve similar success.

       "    'text': 'WHAT IS A CULTURAL LANDSCAPE INVENTORY?A Cultural Landscape Inventory (CLI) is a comprehensive tool critical for the understanding of a cultural landscape associated with a National Historic Landmark property.Section I: Site History includes a narrative and graphic account of the landscape\\'s development through the present focusing on the historic period to provide context for the later sections.Section II: Existing Conditions & Analysis documents and assesses the extant features in the landscape, focusing on landscape characteristics and features that contribute to the significance of the historic property. It analyzes each feature\\'s relationship to the historic period, and determines which extant landscape characteristics and features date to the historic period and therefore contribute to the significance of the historic district.Section III: Evaluation reviews the existing historic documentation and makes recommendations for updates to the documentation using National Register of Historic Places and National Historic Landmark program guidelines. The boundary, period of significance, areas of significance, and criteria are all evaluated. Work for all sections was performed in conformance with guidelines established by various documents that lead this work including The Secretary of the Interior\\'s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for the Treatment of Cultural Landscapes; A Guide to Cultural Landscape Reports: Contents, Process, and Techniques; and the Cultural Landscapes Inventory Professional Procedures Guide.METHODOLOGYThe methodology for developing this Cultural Landscape Inventory blends traditional research, documentation and analysis methods with modern methods and tools. In particular, the site history was developed using traditional research methods by visiting select archives and repositories known to hold written and graphic materials relating to the history of the Civic Center\\'s development. Additional research was gleaned through various online sources, some relating to the brick and mortar repositories that the research team visited, but also extending to solely online sources of verifiable data.The existing conditions were documented using a base of information gathered from various City of San Francisco departments and public agencies. This base information was sparse and/or needed a great deal of verification by the project team. A field team verified or recorded landscape features that were not previously captured or captured accurately on base maps and with photographs in September 2012. Individual features were verified during subsequent visits. This information was transferred to GIS along with a table of information associated with each feature. Photographs of each feature were tagged in the GIS data. The printed report provides a thorough view of the data that is available in the comprehensive digital GIS inventory, which has been transferred to the San Francisco Planning Department.The existing conditions of the study area are organized using the San Francisco Office of the Assessor-Recorder\\'s numbering convention which assigns each block a unique number. With the exception of blocks 0765 and 0347 which are combined, each block has its own subset of information including a map, a features list, photos of select features, and a summary narrative. There are 15 \"blocks\" total.The analysis and evaluation merges the information gleaned through the research and development of the site history with the inventory of extant features that were documented during field work and verification. Reports, newspaper articles, maps and photographs were used to determine what year or time period a particular feature was built or established. The date or era CLI also provides new information gathered through field survey and archival research. It is clear that the Civic Center Historic District holds a strong association with the citizens of San Francisco. The district has often been the site of civic protests, celebrations and other events. The Civic Center has been heavily involved in the City\\'s most important historic moments including the Great 1906 San Francisco Earthquake and Fires, the rise of San Francisco as a major west coast urban center, use as temporary housing and as a victory garden during World War II, the signing of the United Nations Charter, post World War II urban development efforts, and the assassination of Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk and subsequent riots. While other studies go into depth about specific events this CLI provides a comprehensive overview of significant historic events that have impacted its development.It is the historic district as a whole, its buildings, its spaces and landscape features that need to be fully understood since they were designed to exhibit a harmonious whole and should be treated as such now and into the future. Focusing on the major building elements only includes half the picture. In fact, it is the open spaces and landscape features that were used to reinforce the design aesthetics of the Civic Center that have experienced the greatest threats to their design integrity. For example, Memorial Court was recently the focus of a design competition to determine how best to sensitively incorporate a Veteran\\'s Memorial. Understanding the character-defining features of that landscape was critical in determining a preservation-minded solution that sensitively inserted a new design into a historic landscape. The same is true of many non-building contributing features; with little recognition and limited understanding they have been and could continue to be at a high risk of loss or damage. With very few of those historic features left in the district, it is imperative that the remaining contributing landscape features that date to the historic period and contribute to the significance of the district are recognized and preserved. CULTURAL LANDSCAPE INVENTORY BENEFITSThis Cultural Landscape Inventory for the Civic Center Historic District develops a greater understanding of the extant landscape features and their relationship to the historic period; lays the groundwork for approval by the City of San Francisco and the California\\'s State Office of Historic Preservation for future design interventions; and assists future efforts to update PAGE 8was added to the features inventory and then an evaluation was made noting whether a particular feature dates to the historic period and contributes to the historic character of the district, or post-dates the historic period and is non-contributing to the historic character of the district.The Civic Center survey area includes two known documented and significant archeological sites: the site of the former Yerba Buena Cemetery (a triangular site bounded by McAllister Street to the north, Market Street to the south, and Larkin Street to the west); and portions of Old City Hall foundation located at the current site of blocks: 0353, part of 0354 and part of 0351 (see 1905 period plan). This area was studied in depth before construction of the new public library in the 1990s and during rehabilitation of the Federal Building in 2012. The rehabilitation of the former library into the Asian Art Museum may have also included an archaeological study, but no records were found that outlined that type of effort.1 Although a study of archeological sites was not within the scope of the CLI, it is important to recognize that these sites exist within the district and should be considered in future planning.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Fault segments The SFBR model is built upon the seven characterized faults mentioned above . Each fault is divided into as many as four, non-overlapping segments - 18 segments in all. These segments are the basic building blocks for earthquake ruptures on each fault. Each fault segment has length L, width W, geologic slip velocity v, and seismogenic scaling factor R, which accounts for any part of the geologic slip that is aseismic (Figure 2.5, Table 3.8). Rupture sources Unlike WG90, which considered only single-segment ruptures, the present study allows for the simultaneous rupture of two or more adjacent segments of a fault. Each possible combination of segments is a rupture source. These rupture sources-35 in all-are listed in Table 4.8. A mean magnitude is computed for each rupture source based on its seismogenic area A (determined by L, W\\' and R on each of its segments) through \"M-log A\" relations, as described in Chapter 4. Floating earthquakes Each fault (except Mt. Diablo) is host to floating earthquakes-earthquakes of a specified magnitude but without a fixed location. Floating earthquakes, which allow for the fact that some earthquakes are not represented by the prescribed segmentation, are also classified and treated as rupture sources and are listed in Table 4.3. Rupture scenarios A rupture scenario is a combination of rupture sources that describes a possible mode of failure of the entire fault during one earthquake cycle. For example, in one rupture scenario the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault fails only in 3-segment ruptures, in another it fails only in single-segment ruptures, and in a third scenario it fails in combinations of 1-segment and 2-segment ruptures (Table 3.4). Fault rupture models A fault rupture model us a weighted combinations of the rupture scenarios for a fault, each combination representing one possibility for the long-term behavior of the fault. The weights are determined by expert opinion. The fault rupture models serve the same function as the \"earthquake-cascade\" models employed in WG95 (SCEC, 1995). For most faults, multiple fault rupture models are considered. Regional model A viable regional model is an aggregate of seven rupture models (one for each fault) and a background earthquake model (described below) that satisfies a plate-motion slip rate constraint across the entire SFBR defined by geodetic observations. A regional model provides a complete description of the long-term earthquake activity in the SFBR. Chapter 2, page 5',\n",

Producing affordable housing in what is often the most expensive housing market in the nation obviously takes substantial financial resources. In San Francisco, affordable housing is primarily produced by three sectors: non-profit housing developers who are funded in part by the (former) San Francisco Redevelopment Agency and the Mayor\\'s Office of Housing; the San Francisco Housing Authority (through the HOPE VI and HOPE SF programs); and market-rate developers operating in accordance with the inclusionary housing program or the jobs-housing linkage program. The City\\'s development capacity has expanded over time. Spurred on by, and in partnership with, nonprofit developers and housing advocates, the City has implemented revenue strategies that have provided significant funding for the preservation, rehabilitation and development of affordable housing. Between FY 2002-03 and FY 2010-11, more than $725 million was applied to affordable housing from City and locally-controlled funding sources, over $356 million from state sources and over $829 million from federal sources, all totaling just under $2 billion dollars.17 As state and federal sources of affordable housing financing shrink, local funding initiatives and sources become even more critical.

       "    'text': 'Abolish Anti-Homeless Laws The SFPD claims that it must respond to 911 calls regarding illegal activity and cite those who are committing a crime. Therefore the most effective means to end the practice of citing homeless persons for sitting or sleeping is to abolish such laws. This year a Right to Rest Act Bill was heard in California\\'s legislature which would prohibit the enforcement of anti-homeless laws (see conclusion for more detail). It will be heard again next year. San Francisco\\'s mayor and board of supervisors should publicly support the legislation. 72 Elaine Forbes et. al., \"Processing Quality of Life Violations,\" SF Office of Budget and Legislative Analyst (2002). 73 UC Berkeley Law School Policy Advocacy Clinic, supra note 5. 44 Reform the Broken and Costly Court Process for Infractions Court Administration and District Attorney Reforms Grant amnesty to those who receive \"quality of life\" tickets and are too poor to pay them, through the powers of the District Attorney. This has been done in the past and can become institutionalized if such laws and enforcement cannot be changed at a legislative level. Allow for fees associated with community services to be easily waived, and inform defendants of a clear process to do so. Stop Issuing Warrants, Arrest, and Suspension of Drivers Licenses for Unpaid Fines Court Administration and District Attorney Reforms Halt the practice of issuing arrest warrants for unpaid fines of \"quality of life\" offenses. End the suspension of driver\\'s license as a tool of debt collection, particularly for non-traffic offenses. Stop sending unpaid \"quality of life\" tickets to collection agencies. Improve Information and Accountability on the Impacts and Costs of \"Quality of Life\" Policing and Citation. Agency Reforms Supervisors should request the Legislative Analyst Office to undertake a study similar to that of the 2002 report on the \"Processing \\'Quality of Life\\' Violations,\" which would reveal the current cost of enforcement and court processing. Currently, the courts and Sheriff, are not tracking the frequency, process, or cost of \"quality of life\" citations or arrest. The SFPD is now tracking this with a new computer program, but it is not made readily available. Require the SFPD to publicly and properly report such findings in their monthly crime reports.',\n",
