1. Structured knowledge is used by which of the following components in Watson?
	d) Evidence Diffusion - evidence diffusion is used to propagate evidence across different candidate answers related in the ontology
2. Why is a TyCor framework necessary for Watson?
	a) To expand Watson's ability to detect any possible type of answers - Type Coercion, or TyCor, uses a process of entity disambiguation and matching, predicate disambiguation and matching, type recognition, and type alignment to determine the answer type for candidate answers and matches it with the lexical answer type as detected in the question. Because any word can be a lexical answer type, there is not a single ontology able to perform the TyCor operation with good coverage.
3. How large an impact does TyCor have on the accuracy for the Jeopardy! system?
	- The combined use of all the strategies implemented for type coercion in the Watson Jeopardy! system lead to a 10% improvement in accuracy.
4. Which contributed more to the improvement of Watson: 
	b) Type Coercion - And the 10 percent improvement at that level is huge, so we are talking about more than even the machine learning, all the machine learning improvement that they showed with respect to the baseline are less than this number here.
